## Core Workflow for Fashion Brands

### The 5 Keys to Viral Clothing Videos
1. **Show the fit** — multiple angles (front, side, movement test)
2. **Real-life context** — not studio, show it being worn in actual life
3. **Movement proof** — sit, stand, twirl — show it moves naturally
4. **Authentic lighting** — no fancy studio lighting, natural window light
5. **Specific details** — fabric texture, belt, flare, fit description

## Shot List for Fashion Ads

| Shot | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Mirror selfie | 0:00–0:03 | "No fancy lighting" line, full outfit visible |
| Front view | 0:03–0:06 | Jump cut, full front |
| Side view | 0:06–0:09 | Jump cut, profile |
| Movement test | 0:09–0:12 | Twirl or sit/stand |
| CTA | 0:12–0:15 | Point to caption/link area |

## Key Learnings

1. **Specificity wins** — "belted here and flares at the bottom" beats "nice dress"
2. **Movement = proof** — showing movement removes the #1 objection (will it look good on me?)
3. **No fancy lighting** — explicitly saying this builds authenticity
4. **Multiple angles** — minimum 3 angles per try-on video
5. **Jump cuts** — fast transitions between angles keep attention

## Pipeline Implications

| Learning | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| Multi-angle shots | Generate 3 clips per outfit: front/side/movement |
| Specificity in prompts | Include exact clothing details in motionPrompt |
| Movement proof | Add "movement test" shot to fashion angle templates |
