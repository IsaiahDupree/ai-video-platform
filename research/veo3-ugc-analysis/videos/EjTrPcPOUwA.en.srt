So, let me start off by showing you guys
 

65
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,950
So, let me start off by showing you guys
the first method where you don't need to

66
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
the first method where you don't need to
 

67
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,469
the first method where you don't need to
be filming yourself. You're just going

68
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
be filming yourself. You're just going
 

69
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,270
be filming yourself. You're just going
to simply be using full AI to do the

70
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
to simply be using full AI to do the
 

71
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,190
to simply be using full AI to do the
whole process for you. So, guys, the

72
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
whole process for you. So, guys, the
 

73
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,469
whole process for you. So, guys, the
first thing that I want to do is show

first thing that I want to do is show
 

75
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,670
first thing that I want to do is show
you the product that I'm going to be

76
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
you the product that I'm going to be
 

77
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,710
you the product that I'm going to be
using as the example with this new AI

78
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
using as the example with this new AI
 

79
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,550
using as the example with this new AI
model method, which is going to be the

80
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
model method, which is going to be the
 

81
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,950
model method, which is going to be the
Rose Teddy Bear. Now, this product I've

82
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
Rose Teddy Bear. Now, this product I've
 

83
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,390
Rose Teddy Bear. Now, this product I've
chosen because it's one of the most

84
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
chosen because it's one of the most
 

85
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,069
chosen because it's one of the most
recognizable products in the industry.

86
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
recognizable products in the industry.
 

87
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,069
recognizable products in the industry.
And number two, it's almost Valentine's

88
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
And number two, it's almost Valentine's
 

89
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,590
And number two, it's almost Valentine's
Day, so I thought it matches quite

90
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
Day, so I thought it matches quite
 

91
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,510
Day, so I thought it matches quite
nicely and the colors pink in the

92
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
nicely and the colors pink in the
 

93
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,030
nicely and the colors pink in the
background. So, I thought it all goes

94
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
background. So, I thought it all goes
 

95
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,710
background. So, I thought it all goes
together very nicely. Now, the other

96
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
together very nicely. Now, the other
 

97
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,990
together very nicely. Now, the other
reason why I chose this product is

98
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
reason why I chose this product is
 

99
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,069
reason why I chose this product is
because this rose teddy bear has a lot

100
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
because this rose teddy bear has a lot
 

101
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,550
because this rose teddy bear has a lot
of unique details that the AI will

102
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
of unique details that the AI will
 

103
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,630
of unique details that the AI will
struggle to recreate. So, the more

104
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
struggle to recreate. So, the more
 

105
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,030
struggle to recreate. So, the more
complex your product is, the harder it

106
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
complex your product is, the harder it
 

107
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,870
complex your product is, the harder it
is for AI to recreate. But the reason

108
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
is for AI to recreate. But the reason
 

109
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,069
is for AI to recreate. But the reason
why I chose this is to show you with

110
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
why I chose this is to show you with
 

111
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,109
why I chose this is to show you with
this new AI model method, it can simply

112
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
this new AI model method, it can simply
 

113
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,270
this new AI model method, it can simply
recreate these products without any

114
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
recreate these products without any
 

115
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,670
recreate these products without any
problems and keep product consistency,

116
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
problems and keep product consistency,
 

117
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,109
problems and keep product consistency,
which we all know that the three major

118
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
which we all know that the three major
 

119
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,270
which we all know that the three major
issues is product consistency, character

120
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
issues is product consistency, character
 

121
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,749
issues is product consistency, character
consistency, and the real skin tones

122
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
consistency, and the real skin tones
 

123
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,309
consistency, and the real skin tones
with AI video ads. So, at this point of

124
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
with AI video ads. So, at this point of
 

125
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,670
with AI video ads. So, at this point of
the video, guys, it would be helpful if

126
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
the video, guys, it would be helpful if
 

127
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,750
the video, guys, it would be helpful if
you have your product ready in mind, and

128
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
you have your product ready in mind, and
 

129
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,670
you have your product ready in mind, and
you take a screenshot of the product. So

130
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
you take a screenshot of the product. So
 

131
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,510
you take a screenshot of the product. So
what I've done guys is I've simply took

132
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
what I've done guys is I've simply took
 

133
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,750
what I've done guys is I've simply took
a print screen of my product like this

134
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
a print screen of my product like this
 

135
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,510
a print screen of my product like this
so that I can give it to the AI to

136
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
so that I can give it to the AI to
 

137
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,510
so that I can give it to the AI to
recreate. So you just need a simple

138
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
recreate. So you just need a simple
 

139
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,110
recreate. So you just need a simple
image of the product on a white

140
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
image of the product on a white
 

141
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,790
image of the product on a white
background like this. If you can also

142
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
background like this. If you can also
 

143
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,550
background like this. If you can also
take another print screen of the product

144
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
take another print screen of the product
 

145
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,550
take another print screen of the product
in a different angle. The more images

146
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
in a different angle. The more images
 

147
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,229
in a different angle. The more images
and angles we have of the product on a

148
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
and angles we have of the product on a
 

149
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,150
and angles we have of the product on a
white background, the better the results

150
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
white background, the better the results
 

151
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,430
white background, the better the results
are going to be. So now I've took a

152
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
are going to be. So now I've took a
 

153
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,430
are going to be. So now I've took a
print screen of the product on a white

154
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
print screen of the product on a white
 

155
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,150
print screen of the product on a white
background. I can now move on. So guys,

156
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
background. I can now move on. So guys,
 

157
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,150
background. I can now move on. So guys,
we now need to use the one tool that's

158
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
we now need to use the one tool that's
 

159
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,830
we now need to use the one tool that's

208
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
new AI model that's going to make this
 

209
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,110
new AI model that's going to make this
magical. I'm going to be explaining what

210
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
magical. I'm going to be explaining what
 

211
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,949
magical. I'm going to be explaining what
that new AI model is in a minute, but

212
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
that new AI model is in a minute, but
 

213
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,589
that new AI model is in a minute, but
for now, we need to get the image of our

214
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
for now, we need to get the image of our
 

215
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,589
for now, we need to get the image of our
person holding the product. So now we

216
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
person holding the product. So now we
 

217
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,509
person holding the product. So now we
need to describe the image. Now this

218
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
need to describe the image. Now this
 

219
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,430
need to describe the image. Now this
simple prompt I've used is an attractive

220
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
simple prompt I've used is an attractive
 

221
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,670
simple prompt I've used is an attractive
woman in her 20s holding this rose teddy

222
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
woman in her 20s holding this rose teddy
 

223
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,229
woman in her 20s holding this rose teddy
bear standing in her bedroom. So it's a

224
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
bear standing in her bedroom. So it's a
 

225
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,229
bear standing in her bedroom. So it's a
very simple prompt. The reason why I've

226
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
very simple prompt. The reason why I've
 

227
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,990
very simple prompt. The reason why I've
chose this prompt is because it's a

228
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
chose this prompt is because it's a
 

229
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,430
chose this prompt is because it's a
woman that's going to be gifted this

230
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
woman that's going to be gifted this
 

231
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,190
woman that's going to be gifted this
product. She's going to be roughly in

232
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
product. She's going to be roughly in
 

233
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,110
product. She's going to be roughly in
her 20s and she's going to be holding

234
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
her 20s and she's going to be holding
 

235
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,190
her 20s and she's going to be holding
this rose teddy bear in her hands

236
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
this rose teddy bear in her hands
 

237
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,030
this rose teddy bear in her hands
because she's been given it as a gift

238
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
because she's been given it as a gift
 

239
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,869
because she's been given it as a gift
and it's more likely for her to receive

240
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
and it's more likely for her to receive
 

241
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,190
and it's more likely for her to receive
this in her bedroom or on the couch in

242
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
this in her bedroom or on the couch in
 

243
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,270
this in her bedroom or on the couch in
her living room. So I understand where

244
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
her living room. So I understand where
 

245
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,830
her living room. So I understand where
she's probably going to be. the AI actor

246
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
she's probably going to be. the AI actor
 

247
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,910
she's probably going to be. the AI actor
based on what you're selling. What is

248
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
based on what you're selling. What is
 

249
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,589
based on what you're selling. What is
the individual going to be receiving the

250
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
the individual going to be receiving the
 

251
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,670
the individual going to be receiving the
product? Is it an older person? Are they

252
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
product? Is it an older person? Are they
 

253
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,030
product? Is it an older person? Are they
going to be sat outside? Are they going

254
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
going to be sat outside? Are they going
 

255
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,189
going to be sat outside? Are they going
to be sat inside? So, once you figure

256
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
to be sat inside? So, once you figure
 

257
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,270
to be sat inside? So, once you figure
that out, it should be very easy. You're

258
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
that out, it should be very easy. You're
 

259
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,030

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,150
image of the lady holding the rose teddy
bear. Now, when you receive these

314
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
bear. Now, when you receive these
 

315
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,749
bear. Now, when you receive these
images, you need to think logically

316
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
images, you need to think logically
 

317
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,350
images, you need to think logically
because we're going to be using this as

318
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
because we're going to be using this as
 

319
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,390
because we're going to be using this as
the base image for every video we make.

320
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
the base image for every video we make.
 

321
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,790
the base image for every video we make.
So, the AI has to be consistent with

322
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
So, the AI has to be consistent with
 

323
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,230
So, the AI has to be consistent with
what it sees. So, you got to think

324
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
what it sees. So, you got to think
 

325
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,070
what it sees. So, you got to think
logically in the background. You can see

326
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
logically in the background. You can see
 

327
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,510
logically in the background. You can see
here there's like this plant that's

328
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
here there's like this plant that's
 

329
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,590
here there's like this plant that's
floating. This is going to be hard for

330
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
floating. This is going to be hard for
 

331
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,070
floating. This is going to be hard for
the AI to recreate every time. So, I'm

332
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
the AI to recreate every time. So, I'm
 

333
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,909
the AI to recreate every time. So, I'm
going to avoid this image. And I don't

334
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
going to avoid this image. And I don't
 

335
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,590
going to avoid this image. And I don't
like the way she's positioned in the

336
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
like the way she's positioned in the
 

337
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,110
like the way she's positioned in the
frame. So, I'm actually going to avoid

338
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
frame. So, I'm actually going to avoid
 

339
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,350
frame. So, I'm actually going to avoid
this image. This image here is a lot

340
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
this image. This image here is a lot
 

341
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,350
this image. This image here is a lot
easier because the background is easier

342
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
easier because the background is easier
 

343
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,590
easier because the background is easier
for the AI to recreate. So, this image

344
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
for the AI to recreate. So, this image
 

345
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,909
for the AI to recreate. So, this image
is very good and she stood in the middle

346
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
is very good and she stood in the middle
 

347
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,469
is very good and she stood in the middle
and center. So, in my opinion, based on

348
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
and center. So, in my opinion, based on
 

349
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,550
and center. So, in my opinion, based on
this image, like what she's wearing, it

350
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
this image, like what she's wearing, it
 

351
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,469
this image, like what she's wearing, it
should be very easy for the AI to

352
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
should be very easy for the AI to
 

353
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,870
should be very easy for the AI to
recreate this into a video. The third

354
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
recreate this into a video. The third
 

355
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,510
recreate this into a video. The third
image it made is also very good, but I

356
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
image it made is also very good, but I
 

357
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,189
image it made is also very good, but I
don't like the bed being scruffy in the

358
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
don't like the bed being scruffy in the
 

359
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,870
don't like the bed being scruffy in the
background, so I'm going to forget about

360
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
background, so I'm going to forget about
 

361
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,550
background, so I'm going to forget about
it. Now, those three images that you

362
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
it. Now, those three images that you
 

363
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,590
it. Now, those three images that you
made, if you feel like there's something

364
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
made, if you feel like there's something
 

365
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,670
made, if you feel like there's something
that's missing, either reprompt it or

366
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
that's missing, either reprompt it or
 

367
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,830
that's missing, either reprompt it or
just regenerate another three images.

368
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
just regenerate another three images.
 

369
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,150
just regenerate another three images.
Now, in my case, guys, I regenerated

370
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
Now, in my case, guys, I regenerated
 

371
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,390
Now, in my case, guys, I regenerated
some more images. And I've now got this

372
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
some more images. And I've now got this
 

373
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,150
some more images. And I've now got this
image here. So, this is the image I like

374
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
image here. So, this is the image I like
 

375
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,070
image here. So, this is the image I like
because she's smiling. I think the

376
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
because she's smiling. I think the
 

377
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,230
because she's smiling. I think the
outfit's easy to recreate. The size

378
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
outfit's easy to recreate. The size
 

379
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,150
outfit's easy to recreate. The size
portions of the teddy bear and her now

380
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
portions of the teddy bear and her now
 

381
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,629
portions of the teddy bear and her now
look more realistic. So, for me, this is

382
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
look more realistic. So, for me, this is
 

383
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,469
look more realistic. So, for me, this is
the image that I'm going to be using.

384
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
the image that I'm going to be using.
 

385
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,790
the image that I'm going to be using.
So, I'm going to download it in HD. Now,

386
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
So, I'm going to download it in HD. Now,
 

387
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,390
So, I'm going to download it in HD. Now,
the next thing that you're going to want

388
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
the next thing that you're going to want
 

389
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,270
the next thing that you're going to want
to do is head over to chat GBT, change

390
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280

391
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,830
to do is head over to chat GBT, change
it to the 5.2 model, and then you're

392
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840

393
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,430
it to the 5.2 model, and then you're
going to want to upload that image we

just downloaded, and you're going to
 

397
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,870
just downloaded, and you're going to
send, I need a prompt for this image to

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
turn it into a Google V3 video. Another
 

401
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,749
turn it into a Google V3 video. Another
purpose of this is to have it as a UGC

402
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
purpose of this is to have it as a UGC
 

403
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,390
purpose of this is to have it as a UGC
style or a POV style video of a woman

404
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400

natural looking advertisement to
 

409
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,830
natural looking advertisement to
showcase it. So, I need a prompt to give

410
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
showcase it. So, I need a prompt to give
 

411
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,469

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
250 likes on this video, I will leave a
 

415
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,390

Google doc sheet with all the prompts
 

417
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,469

418
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
that I've used within this video. But do
 

419
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,909
that I've used within this video. But do
bear in mind the prompts that I've used,

420
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
bear in mind the prompts that I've used,
 

421
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,749
bear in mind the prompts that I've used,
you are going to have to recreate them

422
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
you are going to have to recreate them
 

423
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,430
you are going to have to recreate them
to match your product cuz obviously I'm

424
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
to match your product cuz obviously I'm
 

425
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,189
to match your product cuz obviously I'm
selling a rose teddy bear. The base

426
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
selling a rose teddy bear. The base
 

427
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,390
selling a rose teddy bear. The base
prompt is fine, but you're going to have

428
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
prompt is fine, but you're going to have
 

429
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,230
prompt is fine, but you're going to have
to read certain parts like what your

430
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
to read certain parts like what your
 

431
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,469
to read certain parts like what your
product is and who your avatar is. You

432
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
product is and who your avatar is. You
 

433
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,990
product is and who your avatar is. You
can't just copy and paste them. Then you

434
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
can't just copy and paste them. Then you
 

435
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,189
can't just copy and paste them. Then you
can see here it says, "Here's the clean,

436
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
can see here it says, "Here's the clean,
 

437
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,990
can see here it says, "Here's the clean,
ready to go Google V3 prompt design."

438
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
ready to go Google V3 prompt design."
 

439
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,830
ready to go Google V3 prompt design."
Now, after that response, I reuploaded

440
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
Now, after that response, I reuploaded
 

441
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,749
Now, after that response, I reuploaded
the image again. I actually sent it a

442
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
the image again. I actually sent it a
 

443
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,430
the image again. I actually sent it a
prompt with the link of the product on

444
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
prompt with the link of the product on
 

445
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,670
prompt with the link of the product on
AliExpress. I then said, "Give me some

446
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
AliExpress. I then said, "Give me some
 

447
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,830
AliExpress. I then said, "Give me some
Photoshop ideas that I can turn this

448
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
Photoshop ideas that I can turn this
 

449
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,150
Photoshop ideas that I can turn this
into videos of the rose teddy bear. So,

450
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
into videos of the rose teddy bear. So,
 

451
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,430
into videos of the rose teddy bear. So,
for example, I'm making an

452
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
for example, I'm making an
 

453
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,510
for example, I'm making an
advertisement, a Tik Tok video ad. So,

454
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
advertisement, a Tik Tok video ad. So,
 

455
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,510
advertisement, a Tik Tok video ad. So,
what other poses can we put her in?

456
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
what other poses can we put her in?
 

457
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,670
what other poses can we put her in?
Maybe her sitting on the bed, maybe her

458
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
Maybe her sitting on the bed, maybe her
 

459
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,070
Maybe her sitting on the bed, maybe her
with her boyfriend. I'm not sure what we

460
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
with her boyfriend. I'm not sure what we
 

461
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,749
with her boyfriend. I'm not sure what we
could do." I want you to come up with

462
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
could do." I want you to come up with
 

463
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,749
could do." I want you to come up with
the ideas that you think would work for

464
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
the ideas that you think would work for
 

465
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,270
the ideas that you think would work for
an ad. Now, the reason why we're not

466
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
an ad. Now, the reason why we're not
 

467
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,670
an ad. Now, the reason why we're not
just going off the base question we gave

468
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
just going off the base question we gave
 

469
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,430
just going off the base question we gave
it first is because we're training the

470
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
it first is because we're training the
 

471
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,510
it first is because we're training the
AIGBT to understand what we're selling

472
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
AIGBT to understand what we're selling
 

473
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,189
AIGBT to understand what we're selling
and the reason why. So, the follow-up

474
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
and the reason why. So, the follow-up
 

475
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,029
and the reason why. So, the follow-up
prompt will then give us the better

476
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
prompt will then give us the better
 

477
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,869
prompt will then give us the better
result. So, now you can see here it goes

478
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
result. So, now you can see here it goes
 

479
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,749
result. So, now you can see here it goes
over high converting Photoshop plus

480
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
over high converting Photoshop plus
 

481
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,309
over high converting Photoshop plus
video ideas. Again, we're still training

482
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
video ideas. Again, we're still training
 

483
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,309
video ideas. Again, we're still training
the AI guys. So, now the last prompt

484
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
the AI guys. So, now the last prompt
 

485
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,909
the AI guys. So, now the last prompt
we're going to give it is I need you to

486
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
we're going to give it is I need you to
 

487
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,469
we're going to give it is I need you to
give me Google Banana Prompt to turn it

488
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
give me Google Banana Prompt to turn it
 

489
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,790
give me Google Banana Prompt to turn it
into images. And then I need you to give

490
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
into images. And then I need you to give
 

491
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,589
into images. And then I need you to give
me Google V3 prompts to turn those

492
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
me Google V3 prompts to turn those
 

493
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,909
me Google V3 prompts to turn those
images into a video. Now, essentially

494
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
images into a video. Now, essentially
 

495
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,510
images into a video. Now, essentially
what we're doing, guys, is we're getting

496
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
what we're doing, guys, is we're getting
 

497
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,230
what we're doing, guys, is we're getting
the AI to give us new Google Banana

498
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
the AI to give us new Google Banana
 

499
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,950
the AI to give us new Google Banana
Prompts to create new images that we

500
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
Prompts to create new images that we
 

501
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,869
Prompts to create new images that we
will then turn into videos. But the

502
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
will then turn into videos. But the
 

503
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,070
will then turn into videos. But the
reason why we have to turn them into

504
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
reason why we have to turn them into
 

505
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,909
reason why we have to turn them into
images first is because that's how we're

506
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
images first is because that's how we're
 

507
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,230
images first is because that's how we're
going to keep character consistency and

508
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
going to keep character consistency and
 

509
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,469
going to keep character consistency and
then product consistency. Now, this is

510
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
then product consistency. Now, this is
 

511
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,550
then product consistency. Now, this is
where we get the gold that we needed. So

512
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
where we get the gold that we needed. So
 

513
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,110
where we get the gold that we needed. So
you can see here now it's giving me the

514
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
you can see here now it's giving me the
 

515
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,190
you can see here now it's giving me the
prompt for the Google Banana Pro and

516
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
prompt for the Google Banana Pro and
 

517
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,190
prompt for the Google Banana Pro and
then underneath it is giving us our

518
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
then underneath it is giving us our
 

519
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,750
then underneath it is giving us our
Google VO3 which then turns it from an

520
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
Google VO3 which then turns it from an
 

521
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,550
Google VO3 which then turns it from an
image into a video. So essentially we

522
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
image into a video. So essentially we
 

523
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,070
image into a video. So essentially we
just need to go through all of these

524
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
just need to go through all of these
 

525
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,230
just need to go through all of these
prompts one by one. So what I'm going to

526
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
prompts one by one. So what I'm going to
 

527
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,590
prompts one by one. So what I'm going to
do guys is I'm going to take the first

528
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
do guys is I'm going to take the first
 

529
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,269
do guys is I'm going to take the first
one here which is sitting on the bed

530
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
one here which is sitting on the bed
 

531
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,350
one here which is sitting on the bed
cozy gift moment. So I'm literally just

532
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
cozy gift moment. So I'm literally just
 

533
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,630
cozy gift moment. So I'm literally just
going to copy this prompt. I'm going to

534
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
going to copy this prompt. I'm going to
 

535
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,030
going to copy this prompt. I'm going to
go back to Arcer Ads. I'm now going to

536
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
go back to Arcer Ads. I'm now going to
 

537
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,509
go back to Arcer Ads. I'm now going to
change the reference image, guys, to the

538
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
change the reference image, guys, to the
 

539
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,829
change the reference image, guys, to the
image that we just downloaded, which is

540
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
image that we just downloaded, which is
 

541
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,389
image that we just downloaded, which is
the first image. So, you can see now the

542
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
the first image. So, you can see now the
 

543
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,630
the first image. So, you can see now the
new reference image is the image that we

544
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
new reference image is the image that we
 

545
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,710
new reference image is the image that we
just had previously. And now I'm going

546
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
just had previously. And now I'm going
 

547
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,110
just had previously. And now I'm going
to paste a new prompt. And now you can

548
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
to paste a new prompt. And now you can
 

549
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,670
to paste a new prompt. And now you can
probably turn the variations down from 3

550
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
probably turn the variations down from 3
 

551
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,590
probably turn the variations down from 3
to two. And then we're going to click

552
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
to two. And then we're going to click
 

553
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,269
to two. And then we're going to click
send. And now, whilst we're waiting for

554
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
send. And now, whilst we're waiting for
 

555
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,030
send. And now, whilst we're waiting for
these images to be generated, we can go

556
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
these images to be generated, we can go
 

557
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,110
these images to be generated, we can go
back and actually grab the Google V3

558
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
back and actually grab the Google V3
 

559
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,389
back and actually grab the Google V3
banana prompt and we can copy it from

560
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
banana prompt and we can copy it from
 

561
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,910
banana prompt and we can copy it from
natural. So you don't need the first

562
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
natural. So you don't need the first
 

563
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,430
natural. So you don't need the first
part, you just need the natural part.

564
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
part, you just need the natural part.
 

565
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,430
part, you just need the natural part.
And we can paste it in here. And then

566
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
And we can paste it in here. And then
 

567
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,870
And we can paste it in here. And then
what we can do, guys, is we can change

568
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
what we can do, guys, is we can change
 

569
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,190
what we can do, guys, is we can change
this from image to video. And then where

570
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
this from image to video. And then where
 

571
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,470
this from image to video. And then where
it says video, we're going to go to the

572
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
it says video, we're going to go to the
 

573
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,509
it says video, we're going to go to the
right hand side and we're going to see

574
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
right hand side and we're going to see
 

575
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,750
right hand side and we're going to see
the model. We're going to use VO3.1.

576
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
the model. We're going to use VO3.1.
 

577
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,509
the model. We're going to use VO3.1.
We're going to use 9x6 and we're going

578
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
We're going to use 9x6 and we're going
 

579
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,509
We're going to use 9x6 and we're going
to use 1080p. And this is where we're

580
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
to use 1080p. And this is where we're
 

581
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,670
to use 1080p. And this is where we're
going to paste the prompt. So now guys,

582
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
going to paste the prompt. So now guys,
 

583
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,509
going to paste the prompt. So now guys,
you can see that we've got the new image

584
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
you can see that we've got the new image
 

585
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,910
you can see that we've got the new image
generated. So this image here is the one

586
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
generated. So this image here is the one
 

587
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,590
generated. So this image here is the one
that I like the most. She's looking down

588
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
that I like the most. She's looking down
 

589
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,750
that I like the most. She's looking down
at the teddy bear sat on the bed. And

590
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
at the teddy bear sat on the bed. And
 

591
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,350
at the teddy bear sat on the bed. And
you can see the background has stayed

592
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
you can see the background has stayed
 

593
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,190
you can see the background has stayed
consistent because we gave it the

594
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
consistent because we gave it the
 

595
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,030
consistent because we gave it the
reference image. Now the other image it

596
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
reference image. Now the other image it
 

597
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,630
reference image. Now the other image it
made is okay, but I'm not a fan of the

598
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
made is okay, but I'm not a fan of the
 

599
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,389
made is okay, but I'm not a fan of the
way she's positioned. I think this one

600
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
way she's positioned. I think this one
 

601
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,230
way she's positioned. I think this one
looks more natural. So I can download

602
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
looks more natural. So I can download
 

603
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,389
looks more natural. So I can download
the image. So now I've downloaded the

604
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
the image. So now I've downloaded the
 

605
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,150
the image. So now I've downloaded the
image. I can go to the reference option

606
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
image. I can go to the reference option
 

607
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,310
image. I can go to the reference option
here, add a reference image, and I can

608
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
here, add a reference image, and I can
 

609
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,630
here, add a reference image, and I can
add the new image here. And then I can

610
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
add the new image here. And then I can
 

611
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,870
add the new image here. And then I can
simply click send. So now that's going

612
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
simply click send. So now that's going
 

613
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,829
simply click send. So now that's going
to turn that image into a video. Now we

614
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
to turn that image into a video. Now we
 

615
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,790
to turn that image into a video. Now we
still haven't used the new AI model yet.

616
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
still haven't used the new AI model yet.
 

617
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,710
still haven't used the new AI model yet.
That's going to happen after the video

618
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
That's going to happen after the video
 

619
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,030
That's going to happen after the video
is generated and I'll explain the reason

620
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
is generated and I'll explain the reason
 

621
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,150
is generated and I'll explain the reason
why in the next few moments. So now you

622
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
why in the next few moments. So now you
 

623
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,870
why in the next few moments. So now you
guys can see the video has come back to

624
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
guys can see the video has come back to
 

625
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:40,150
guys can see the video has come back to
us. So let's view the video together.

626
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160

 

627
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,550

So as you guys just saw there, the video

628
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
So as you guys just saw there, the video
 

629
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,190
So as you guys just saw there, the video
actually looks really good that V3 made.

630
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
actually looks really good that V3 made.
 

631
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,790
actually looks really good that V3 made.
Now, you might be wondering, why did we

632
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
Now, you might be wondering, why did we
 

633
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,030
Now, you might be wondering, why did we
get Google V3 to make a video if we're

634
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
get Google V3 to make a video if we're
 

635
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,870
get Google V3 to make a video if we're
not going to be using this as the main

636
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
not going to be using this as the main
 

637
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,110
not going to be using this as the main
model? And the reason why is because at

638
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
model? And the reason why is because at
 

639
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,470
model? And the reason why is because at
the beginning, I said to you, you got

640
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
the beginning, I said to you, you got
 

641
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,949
the beginning, I said to you, you got
two options. You can either create the

642
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
two options. You can either create the
 

643
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,870
two options. You can either create the
motion yourself, which is the advanced

644
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
motion yourself, which is the advanced
 

645
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,150
motion yourself, which is the advanced
version, or you can simply get AI to

646
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
version, or you can simply get AI to
 

647
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,150
version, or you can simply get AI to
create the motion. So, essentially what

648
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
create the motion. So, essentially what
 

649
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,670
create the motion. So, essentially what
we're doing here is we're getting Google

650
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
we're doing here is we're getting Google
 

651
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,949
we're doing here is we're getting Google
V3 to create the motion. And now we're

652
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
V3 to create the motion. And now we're
 

653
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,470
V3 to create the motion. And now we're
going to give it to the new AI model

654
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
going to give it to the new AI model
 

655
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,310
going to give it to the new AI model
called Cling 2.6 to then recreate. So

656
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
called Cling 2.6 to then recreate. So
 

657
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,670
called Cling 2.6 to then recreate. So
now what we're going to do guys is we're

658
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
now what we're going to do guys is we're
 

659
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,590
now what we're going to do guys is we're
going to download this video and then

660
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
going to download this video and then
 

661
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,030
going to download this video and then
we're going to go over to where it says

662
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
we're going to go over to where it says
 

663
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,710
we're going to go over to where it says
see more and then you're going to see

664
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
see more and then you're going to see
 

665
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,829
see more and then you're going to see
this new one here guys called cling 2.6

666
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
this new one here guys called cling 2.6
 

667
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,550
this new one here guys called cling 2.6
motion control. So this is the new AI

668
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
motion control. So this is the new AI
 

669
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,190
motion control. So this is the new AI
model that allows you to create any

670
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
model that allows you to create any
 

671
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,389
model that allows you to create any
motion and edit to any image that you

672
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
motion and edit to any image that you
 

673
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,470
motion and edit to any image that you
want. So now you're going to see upload

674
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
want. So now you're going to see upload
 

675
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,470
want. So now you're going to see upload
character image. This is going to be the

676
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
character image. This is going to be the
 

677
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,310
character image. This is going to be the
character image that we created with

678
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
character image that we created with
 

679
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,310
character image that we created with
Google banana. And then the reference

680
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
Google banana. And then the reference
 

681
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,870
Google banana. And then the reference
video is going to be the Google VO3 that

682
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
video is going to be the Google VO3 that
 

683
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,710
video is going to be the Google VO3 that
we've just created. So we've given it

684
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
we've just created. So we've given it
 

685
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,470
we've just created. So we've given it
the base image and then we're going to

686
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
the base image and then we're going to
 

687
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,710
the base image and then we're going to
give it the motion video. So this video

688
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
give it the motion video. So this video
 

689
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,949
give it the motion video. So this video
here is basically the motion. We're

690
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
here is basically the motion. We're
 

691
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,430
here is basically the motion. We're
going to get Cling 2.6 to add to the

692
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
going to get Cling 2.6 to add to the
 

693
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,030
going to get Cling 2.6 to add to the
video. And essentially Cling 2.6 is the

694
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
video. And essentially Cling 2.6 is the
 

695
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,310
video. And essentially Cling 2.6 is the
industryleading motion for video. So

696
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
industryleading motion for video. So
 

697
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,550
industryleading motion for video. So
this should create a video now where

698
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
this should create a video now where
 

699
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,550
this should create a video now where
it's going to be a lot more accurate of

700
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
it's going to be a lot more accurate of
 

701
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,110
it's going to be a lot more accurate of
the AI avatar doing that scene. Because

702
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
the AI avatar doing that scene. Because
 

703
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,990
the AI avatar doing that scene. Because
if you watch the Google VO3 one slowly,

704
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
if you watch the Google VO3 one slowly,
 

705
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,069
if you watch the Google VO3 one slowly,
you can see that you can tell it's AI

706
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
you can see that you can tell it's AI
 

707
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,910
you can see that you can tell it's AI
because the way she's holding the teddy

708
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
because the way she's holding the teddy
 

709
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,910
because the way she's holding the teddy
bear and bringing it to herself, it

710
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
bear and bringing it to herself, it
 

711
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,470
bear and bringing it to herself, it
doesn't look natural and the teddy bear

712
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
doesn't look natural and the teddy bear
 

713
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,870
doesn't look natural and the teddy bear
changes size. So, you can slightly tell

714
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
changes size. So, you can slightly tell
 

715
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,110
changes size. So, you can slightly tell
that it isn't real. And that is the main

716
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
that it isn't real. And that is the main
 

717
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,069
that it isn't real. And that is the main
issue right now with video models. There

718
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
issue right now with video models. There
 

719
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,069
issue right now with video models. There
are times you can tell it's not real

720
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
are times you can tell it's not real
 

721
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,990
are times you can tell it's not real
because of the motion that they do. The

722
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
because of the motion that they do. The
 

723
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,990
because of the motion that they do. The
motion does not look natural. And this

724
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
motion does not look natural. And this
 

725
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,190
motion does not look natural. And this
is where Cling 2.6 fixes that issue. And

726
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
is where Cling 2.6 fixes that issue. And
 

727
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,430
is where Cling 2.6 fixes that issue. And
this is where you guys have the choice

728
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
this is where you guys have the choice
 

729
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,509
this is where you guys have the choice
whether you want to get the AI to create

730
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
whether you want to get the AI to create
 

731
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,150
whether you want to get the AI to create
the motion like I got Google V3 to do it

732
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
the motion like I got Google V3 to do it
 

733
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,790
the motion like I got Google V3 to do it
or you just simply get your phone and

734
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
or you just simply get your phone and
 

735
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,430
or you just simply get your phone and
you record yourself with a product in

736
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
you record yourself with a product in
 

737
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,590
you record yourself with a product in
your hand or anything in your hand that

738
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
your hand or anything in your hand that
 

739
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,829
your hand or anything in your hand that
can replicate the product and you create

740
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
can replicate the product and you create
 

741
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,829
can replicate the product and you create
the emotion image. You can see that

742
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
the emotion image. You can see that
 

743
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,829
the emotion image. You can see that
she's sat on a bed with the teddy in her

744
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
she's sat on a bed with the teddy in her
 

745
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,790
she's sat on a bed with the teddy in her
hand. So I can now sit on a bed or a

746
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
hand. So I can now sit on a bed or a
 

747
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,190
hand. So I can now sit on a bed or a
sofa in a similar position and then

748
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
sofa in a similar position and then
 

749
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,110
sofa in a similar position and then
recreate the motion. So, let's pretend

750
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
recreate the motion. So, let's pretend
 

751
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,829
recreate the motion. So, let's pretend
this here is the teddy. I can look down

752
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
this here is the teddy. I can look down
 

753
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,470
this here is the teddy. I can look down
like she is and I can pretend to do this

754
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
like she is and I can pretend to do this
 

755
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,790
like she is and I can pretend to do this
motion, which is her bringing the teddy

756
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
motion, which is her bringing the teddy
 

757
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,910
motion, which is her bringing the teddy
to hug it. So, it's completely up to you

758
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
to hug it. So, it's completely up to you
 

759
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,069
to hug it. So, it's completely up to you
guys whether you get the AI to do it or

760
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
guys whether you get the AI to do it or
 

761
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,629
guys whether you get the AI to do it or
you simply get your phone and create the

762
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
you simply get your phone and create the
 

763
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,629
you simply get your phone and create the
motion yourself. Now, in my opinion, if

764
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
motion yourself. Now, in my opinion, if
 

765
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,150
motion yourself. Now, in my opinion, if
I was to say which one's better than the

766
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
I was to say which one's better than the
 

767
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,069
I was to say which one's better than the
other, I think sometimes the AI does

768
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
other, I think sometimes the AI does
 

769
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,750
other, I think sometimes the AI does
better. Sometimes if you were to do it

770
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
better. Sometimes if you were to do it
 

771
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,190
better. Sometimes if you were to do it
yourself, it's better. Now, the only

772
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
yourself, it's better. Now, the only
 

773
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,190
yourself, it's better. Now, the only
downside of you doing it yourself is it

774
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
downside of you doing it yourself is it
 

775
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,110
downside of you doing it yourself is it
takes a little bit more time and you

776
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
takes a little bit more time and you
 

777
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,269
takes a little bit more time and you
have more control. But essentially, the

778
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
have more control. But essentially, the
 

779
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,590
have more control. But essentially, the
reason why we're using Clink is because

780
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
reason why we're using Clink is because
 

781
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,790
reason why we're using Clink is because
it's going to improve the realism of the

782
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
it's going to improve the realism of the
 

783
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,509
it's going to improve the realism of the
motion of the image to video. So, it's

784
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
motion of the image to video. So, it's
 

785
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,110
motion of the image to video. So, it's
going to look more natural. And I'm

786
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
going to look more natural. And I'm
 

787
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,949
going to look more natural. And I'm
going to put a sideby-side comparison on

788
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
going to put a sideby-side comparison on
 

789
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,110
going to put a sideby-side comparison on
the screen showing you this here, which

790
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
the screen showing you this here, which
 

791
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,829
the screen showing you this here, which
is the Google V3 version. And you can

792
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
is the Google V3 version. And you can
 

793
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,069
is the Google V3 version. And you can
see here, this is the video. Then I'm

794
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
see here, this is the video. Then I'm
 

795
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,350
see here, this is the video. Then I'm
going to be showing you what the Cling

796
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
going to be showing you what the Cling
 

797
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,990
going to be showing you what the Cling
AI motion does. So you can see side by

798
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
AI motion does. So you can see side by
 

799
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,710
AI motion does. So you can see side by
side which one looks more realistic. And

800
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
side which one looks more realistic. And
 

801
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,150
side which one looks more realistic. And
I just want to quickly say this, if you

802
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
I just want to quickly say this, if you
 

803
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,550
I just want to quickly say this, if you
were to do the motion yourself, you are

804
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
were to do the motion yourself, you are
 

805
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,790
were to do the motion yourself, you are
going to get better results. And when I

806
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
going to get better results. And when I
 

807
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,110
going to get better results. And when I
say better results, I mean around about

808
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
say better results, I mean around about
 

809
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,710
say better results, I mean around about
30 to 40% better quality on the end

810
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
30 to 40% better quality on the end
 

811
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,990
30 to 40% better quality on the end
result. But if you really don't want to

812
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
result. But if you really don't want to
 

813
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,189
result. But if you really don't want to
be getting your phone out and doing it

814
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
be getting your phone out and doing it
 

815
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,870
be getting your phone out and doing it
yourself, then this is a better

816
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
yourself, then this is a better
 

817
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,629
yourself, then this is a better
alternative. Now, I do also want to say

818
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
alternative. Now, I do also want to say
 

819
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,629
alternative. Now, I do also want to say
that the Cling Motion does take around

820
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
that the Cling Motion does take around
 

821
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,870
that the Cling Motion does take around
about 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes more,

822
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
about 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes more,
 

823
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,870
about 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes more,
to create the video. But what I would

824
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
to create the video. But what I would
 

825
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,389
to create the video. But what I would
say to you guys is whilst you're waiting

826
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
say to you guys is whilst you're waiting
 

827
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,870
say to you guys is whilst you're waiting
for this cling video to be made, I would

828
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
for this cling video to be made, I would
 

829
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,710
for this cling video to be made, I would
move on to the next prompt. So, we're

830
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
move on to the next prompt. So, we're
 

831
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,350
move on to the next prompt. So, we're
going to go back to chat GBT. We're now

832
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
going to go back to chat GBT. We're now
 

833
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,509
going to go back to chat GBT. We're now
going to move on to the boyfriend POV.

834
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
going to move on to the boyfriend POV.
 

835
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,710
going to move on to the boyfriend POV.
So, now we're going to do this one,

836
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
So, now we're going to do this one,
 

837
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,069
So, now we're going to do this one,
guys. We're going to grab this prompt

838
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
guys. We're going to grab this prompt
 

839
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,430
guys. We're going to grab this prompt
here because there's no point you just

840
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
here because there's no point you just
 

841
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,949
here because there's no point you just
sitting there waiting for the video. You

842
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
sitting there waiting for the video. You
 

843
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,550
sitting there waiting for the video. You
might as well start getting on with the

844
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
might as well start getting on with the
 

845
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,670
might as well start getting on with the
next one. So, we're going to go back to

846
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
next one. So, we're going to go back to
 

847
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,189
next one. So, we're going to go back to
Archads. We're going to go to image.

848
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
Archads. We're going to go to image.
 

849
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,310
Archads. We're going to go to image.
We're going to upload the reference

850
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
We're going to upload the reference
 

851
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,470
We're going to upload the reference
image, which is the original image. Only

852
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
image, which is the original image. Only
 

853
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,269
image, which is the original image. Only
upload the original image every time. So

854
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
upload the original image every time. So
 

855
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,750
upload the original image every time. So
when you guys create the next images,

856
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
when you guys create the next images,
 

857
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,189
when you guys create the next images,
you need to make sure the reference

858
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
you need to make sure the reference
 

859
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,829
you need to make sure the reference
image is the same one at the very start.

860
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
image is the same one at the very start.
 

861
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,509
image is the same one at the very start.
Don't make the mistake of taking the

862
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
Don't make the mistake of taking the
 

863
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,350
Don't make the mistake of taking the
second image you made and using that as

864
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
second image you made and using that as
 

865
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,870
second image you made and using that as
the reference image. The reason why we

866
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
the reference image. The reason why we
 

867
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,470
the reference image. The reason why we
got to keep the reference image as this

868
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
got to keep the reference image as this
 

869
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,389
got to keep the reference image as this
one is because the lady is looking

870
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
one is because the lady is looking
 

871
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,629
one is because the lady is looking
directly at the camera. So the AI knows

872
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
directly at the camera. So the AI knows
 

873
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,470
directly at the camera. So the AI knows
what she looks like on both sides of her

874
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
what she looks like on both sides of her
 

875
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,310
what she looks like on both sides of her
face. So that it keeps the bedroom the

876
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
face. So that it keeps the bedroom the
 

877
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,150
face. So that it keeps the bedroom the
same and it keeps her face the same. If

878
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
same and it keeps her face the same. If
 

879
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,389
same and it keeps her face the same. If
I then go and take this image and use it

880
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
I then go and take this image and use it
 

881
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,310
I then go and take this image and use it
as the reference, you cannot see her

882
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
as the reference, you cannot see her
 

883
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,790
as the reference, you cannot see her
face clearly. So, the AI will change her

884
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
face clearly. So, the AI will change her
 

885
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,389
face clearly. So, the AI will change her
face, which means the character

886
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
face, which means the character
 

887
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,629
face, which means the character
consistency won't be there. Now, guys,

888
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
consistency won't be there. Now, guys,
 

889
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,829
consistency won't be there. Now, guys,
what I can do is I can change this

890
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
what I can do is I can change this
 

891
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,910
what I can do is I can change this
prompt over. I can then make sure that

892
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
prompt over. I can then make sure that
 

893
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,269
prompt over. I can then make sure that
we're on the right settings, which is

894
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
we're on the right settings, which is
 

895
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,069
we're on the right settings, which is
Google Banana 9 by6, and I can click

896
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
Google Banana 9 by6, and I can click
 

897
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,509

you guys make sure that you're doing

900
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
you guys make sure that you're doing
 

901
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,629
you guys make sure that you're doing
these alongside of each other. Don't

902
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
these alongside of each other. Don't
 

903
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,389
these alongside of each other. Don't
wait for one to finish. The quickest way

904
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
wait for one to finish. The quickest way
 

905
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,310
wait for one to finish. The quickest way
to get this done is making sure that one

906
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
to get this done is making sure that one
 

907
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,870
to get this done is making sure that one
Cling 2.0 motion is being made. You

908
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
Cling 2.0 motion is being made. You
 

909
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,710
Cling 2.0 motion is being made. You
carry on with the next prompts. For

the cling videos, guys, you're going to
 

919
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,350
the cling videos, guys, you're going to
be sat here for about an hour. So, check

this out, guys. This is the next batch
 

923
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,629
this out, guys. This is the next batch
of images it made. So, you can see the

924

of images it made. So, you can see the
 

925
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,790
of images it made. So, you can see the
AI avatar is the same. The background's

926
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
AI avatar is the same. The background's
 

927
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,710
AI avatar is the same. The background's
the same. Everything's the same. You can

928
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
the same. Everything's the same. You can
 

929
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,389
the same. Everything's the same. You can
see she's looking at somebody as if

930
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
see she's looking at somebody as if
 

931
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,990
see she's looking at somebody as if
somebody was to gift it her. This is the

932
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
somebody was to gift it her. This is the
 

933
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,590
somebody was to gift it her. This is the
boyfriend gifting her the rose teddy

934
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
boyfriend gifting her the rose teddy
 

935
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,509
boyfriend gifting her the rose teddy
bear. But this image is better because

936
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
bear. But this image is better because
 

937
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,590
bear. But this image is better because
look, you can see that the boyfriend's

938
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
look, you can see that the boyfriend's
 

939
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,910
look, you can see that the boyfriend's
arms in it and she's receiving it. So,

940
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
arms in it and she's receiving it. So,
 

941
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,749
arms in it and she's receiving it. So,
this one actually looks really, really

942
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
this one actually looks really, really
 

943
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,509
this one actually looks really, really
good. So, I'm going to actually use this

944
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
good. So, I'm going to actually use this
 

945
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,030
good. So, I'm going to actually use this
image. So, I'm going to download it. I'm

946
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
image. So, I'm going to download it. I'm
 

947
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,949
image. So, I'm going to download it. I'm
then going to go over to video. I'm then

948
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
then going to go over to video. I'm then
 

949
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,230
then going to go over to video. I'm then
going to change it to VO 3.1 9x6. I'm

950
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
going to change it to VO 3.1 9x6. I'm
 

951
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,670
going to change it to VO 3.1 9x6. I'm
going to upload the new reference image,

952
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
going to upload the new reference image,
 

953
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,030
going to upload the new reference image,
which is going to be the image I just

954
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
which is going to be the image I just
 

955
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,790
which is going to be the image I just
downloaded. I'm then going to go to the

956
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
downloaded. I'm then going to go to the
 

957
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,670
downloaded. I'm then going to go to the
prompt POV UGC. Come back here, guys,

958
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
prompt POV UGC. Come back here, guys,
 

959
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,430
prompt POV UGC. Come back here, guys,
and click paste. And then we're going to

960
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
and click paste. And then we're going to
 

961
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,670
and click paste. And then we're going to
click send. And the thing is, whilst I'm

962
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
click send. And the thing is, whilst I'm
 

963
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,509
click send. And the thing is, whilst I'm
waiting for this video to be made, I

964
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
waiting for this video to be made, I
 

965
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,670
waiting for this video to be made, I
might as well move on to the next image

966
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
might as well move on to the next image
 

967
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,230
might as well move on to the next image
because even the Google 3.1 videos can

968
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
because even the Google 3.1 videos can
 

969
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,910
because even the Google 3.1 videos can
take a couple of minutes. So, I might as

970
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
take a couple of minutes. So, I might as
 

971
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,670
take a couple of minutes. So, I might as
well move on to the next image. Just

972
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
well move on to the next image. Just
 

973
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,629
well move on to the next image. Just
make sure that if you're doing this

974
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
make sure that if you're doing this
 

975
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,790
make sure that if you're doing this
quite proactive like I am, you don't get

976
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
quite proactive like I am, you don't get
 

977
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,150
quite proactive like I am, you don't get
mixed up with the prompts because if

978
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
mixed up with the prompts because if
 

979
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,590
mixed up with the prompts because if
you're going at quite a fast speed like

980
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
you're going at quite a fast speed like
 

981
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,670
you're going at quite a fast speed like
I am, you might accidentally mix them

982
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
I am, you might accidentally mix them
 

983
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,509
I am, you might accidentally mix them
up. So, guys, I've just received the

984
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
up. So, guys, I've just received the
 

985
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,470
up. So, guys, I've just received the
first Cling 2.6 motion video back. So,

986
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
first Cling 2.6 motion video back. So,
 

987
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,069
first Cling 2.6 motion video back. So,
let's go and view it together. So, you

988
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
let's go and view it together. So, you
 

989
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,749
let's go and view it together. So, you
can see the first change is the teddy

990
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
can see the first change is the teddy
 

991
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,150
can see the first change is the teddy
bear starts not in her hands. It starts

992
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
bear starts not in her hands. It starts
 

993
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,990
bear starts not in her hands. It starts
out of our hands and let's see it

994
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
out of our hands and let's see it
 

995
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,590
out of our hands and let's see it
together. I usually tell that these

996
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
together. I usually tell that these
 

997
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,909
together. I usually tell that these
motion videos are around about one time

998
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
motion videos are around about one time
 

999
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,829
motion videos are around about one time
slower than they should be. So I

1000
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
slower than they should be. So I
 

1001
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,350
slower than they should be. So I
actually speed these up in the editor.

1002
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
actually speed these up in the editor.
 

1003
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,549
actually speed these up in the editor.
But if you speed this up in the editor,

1004
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
But if you speed this up in the editor,
 

1005
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,029
But if you speed this up in the editor,
it looks a lot better. But generally you

1006
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
it looks a lot better. But generally you
 

1007
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,230
it looks a lot better. But generally you
can see that the overall realism looks a

1008
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
can see that the overall realism looks a
 

1009
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,789
can see that the overall realism looks a
lot better. The proportions, the motion,

1010
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
lot better. The proportions, the motion,
 

1011
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,350
lot better. The proportions, the motion,
the hand gestures look a lot more real.

1012
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
the hand gestures look a lot more real.
 

1013
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,029
the hand gestures look a lot more real.
Now again, we have to speed these videos

1014
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
Now again, we have to speed these videos
 

1015
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,189
Now again, we have to speed these videos
up later in Cap Cut and they look even

1016
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
up later in Cap Cut and they look even
 

1017
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,429
up later in Cap Cut and they look even
more realistic. Now, sometimes I'll be

1018
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
more realistic. Now, sometimes I'll be
 

1019
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,669
more realistic. Now, sometimes I'll be
honest with you, Google V3 does outbeat

1020
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
honest with you, Google V3 does outbeat
 

1021
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,390
honest with you, Google V3 does outbeat
the motion, but usually I will just redo

1022
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
the motion, but usually I will just redo
 

1023
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,470
the motion, but usually I will just redo
the motion again if I don't think it's

1024
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
the motion again if I don't think it's
 

1025
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,870
the motion again if I don't think it's
better, but overall I do believe that

1026
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
better, but overall I do believe that
 

1027
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,470
better, but overall I do believe that
Clling 2.6 makes better quality videos

1028
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
Clling 2.6 makes better quality videos
 

1029
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,990
Clling 2.6 makes better quality videos
than Google V3. Usually when Google does

1030
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
than Google V3. Usually when Google does
 

1031
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,950
than Google V3. Usually when Google does
better is if you don't do a good motion

1032
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
better is if you don't do a good motion
 

1033
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,789
better is if you don't do a good motion
videos. That's why I'm telling you guys

1034
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
videos. That's why I'm telling you guys
 

1035
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,789
videos. That's why I'm telling you guys
it's sometimes better to use your own

1036
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
it's sometimes better to use your own
 

1037
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,390
it's sometimes better to use your own
phone and record yourself doing the

1038
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
phone and record yourself doing the
 

1039
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,310
phone and record yourself doing the
motion because it's going to be more

1040
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
motion because it's going to be more
 

1041
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,870
motion because it's going to be more
realistic. This is just me taking the AI

1042
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
realistic. This is just me taking the AI
 

1043
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,789
realistic. This is just me taking the AI
video and giving it as a motion

1044
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
video and giving it as a motion
 

1045
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,390
video and giving it as a motion
reference. And I've told you guys

1046
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
reference. And I've told you guys
 

1047
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,710
reference. And I've told you guys
already that it's around about 30 to 40%

1048
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
already that it's around about 30 to 40%
 

1049
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,710
already that it's around about 30 to 40%
a lot worse than if you were to do it on

1050
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
a lot worse than if you were to do it on
 

1051
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,390
a lot worse than if you were to do it on
your phone. You can see the video is

1052
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
your phone. You can see the video is
 

1053
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,950
your phone. You can see the video is
ready. Now look what Google V3 has done.

1054
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
ready. Now look what Google V3 has done.
 

1055
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,110
ready. Now look what Google V3 has done.
That is made this video worse. It's

1056
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
That is made this video worse. It's
 

1057
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,190
That is made this video worse. It's
changed the product. So look at this.

1058
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
changed the product. So look at this.
 

1059
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,669
changed the product. So look at this.
It's added this weird brown thing on the

1060
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
It's added this weird brown thing on the
 

1061
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,789
It's added this weird brown thing on the
nose which the product doesn't have. So

1062
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
nose which the product doesn't have. So
 

1063
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,430
nose which the product doesn't have. So
this is where Google V3 breaks. And this

1064
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
this is where Google V3 breaks. And this
 

1065
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,669
this is where Google V3 breaks. And this
is why Cling 2.6 six is better because

1066
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
is why Cling 2.6 six is better because
 

1067
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,590
is why Cling 2.6 six is better because
when we change this into a motion video,

1068
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
when we change this into a motion video,
 

1069
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,350
when we change this into a motion video,
it won't break. But the the motion is

1070
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
it won't break. But the the motion is
 

1071
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,630
it won't break. But the the motion is
the most important part. Let's check

1072
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
the most important part. Let's check
 

1073
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,549
the most important part. Let's check
this out.

1074
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559

 

1075
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,390

and just simply upload the footage that

1226
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
and just simply upload the footage that
 

1227
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,029
and just simply upload the footage that
you have available now. And once you've

1228
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
you have available now. And once you've
 

1229
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,270
you have available now. And once you've
received all the footage, just upload it

1230
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
received all the footage, just upload it
 

1231
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,950
received all the footage, just upload it
here. Now I've just received the footage

1232
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
here. Now I've just received the footage
 

1233
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,870
here. Now I've just received the footage
back, guys. And check this video out.

1234
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
back, guys. And check this video out.
 

1235
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,110
back, guys. And check this video out.
This one looks really, really good. So

1236
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
This one looks really, really good. So
 

1237
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,029
This one looks really, really good. So
you can see how natural and realistic

1238
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
you can see how natural and realistic
 

1239
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,110
you can see how natural and realistic
this looks. And again, this looks

1240
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
this looks. And again, this looks
 

1241
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,710
this looks. And again, this looks
really, really good. That's the video

1242
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
really, really good. That's the video
 

1243
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,510
really, really good. That's the video
that the Cling AI 2.6 made, and it looks

1244
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
that the Cling AI 2.6 made, and it looks
 

1245
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,750
that the Cling AI 2.6 made, and it looks
way better than the Google V3. And like

1246
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
way better than the Google V3. And like
 

1247
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,870
way better than the Google V3. And like
I said to you guys before, if you're

1248
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
I said to you guys before, if you're
 

1249
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,669
I said to you guys before, if you're
having issues with Cling 2.6, it's

1250
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
having issues with Cling 2.6, it's
 

1251
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,270
having issues with Cling 2.6, it's
because the motions that you're giving

1252
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
because the motions that you're giving
 

1253
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,510
because the motions that you're giving
it aren't very good, and it's hard for

1254
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
it aren't very good, and it's hard for
 

1255
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,990
it aren't very good, and it's hard for
the AI to understand. The better the

1256
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
the AI to understand. The better the
 

1257
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,230
the AI to understand. The better the
video you give it of the motion, and

1258
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
video you give it of the motion, and
 

1259
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,990
video you give it of the motion, and
again, you doing it yourself will be a

1260
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
again, you doing it yourself will be a
 

1261
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,310
again, you doing it yourself will be a
lot better, the better the video will

1262
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
lot better, the better the video will
 

1263
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,750
lot better, the better the video will
be. So now you guys can see I've got all

1264
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
be. So now you guys can see I've got all
 

1265
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,870
be. So now you guys can see I've got all
the footage back. So, I'm now going to

1266
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
the footage back. So, I'm now going to
 

1267
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,110
the footage back. So, I'm now going to
dump this into Cap Cut. Now, as I've

1268
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
dump this into Cap Cut. Now, as I've
 

1269
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,950
dump this into Cap Cut. Now, as I've
dumped this all into Cap Cut, guys, I'm

1270
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
dumped this all into Cap Cut, guys, I'm
 

1271
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,710
dumped this all into Cap Cut, guys, I'm
going to think logically about what

1272
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
going to think logically about what
 

1273
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,590
going to think logically about what
video I want first to be the hook or the

1274
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
video I want first to be the hook or the
 

1275
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,430
video I want first to be the hook or the
first part of the video. Now, I actually

1276
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
first part of the video. Now, I actually
 

1277
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,149
first part of the video. Now, I actually
like the second video clip that we made

1278
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
like the second video clip that we made
 

1279
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,510
like the second video clip that we made
more. Now, you don't need to do it in

1280
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
more. Now, you don't need to do it in
 

1281
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,590
more. Now, you don't need to do it in
chronological order, guys. Meaning that

1282
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
chronological order, guys. Meaning that
 

1283
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,230
chronological order, guys. Meaning that
whichever one the GBT gave you as prompt

1284
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
whichever one the GBT gave you as prompt
 

1285
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,990
whichever one the GBT gave you as prompt
one doesn't mean it needs to be number

1286
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
one doesn't mean it needs to be number
 

1287
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,310
one doesn't mean it needs to be number
one in the video sequence. Now, this was

1288
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
one in the video sequence. Now, this was
 

1289
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,549
one in the video sequence. Now, this was
prompt two, and I put it first. And the

1290
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
prompt two, and I put it first. And the
 

1291
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,310
prompt two, and I put it first. And the
reason why is cuz I like the way that

1292
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
reason why is cuz I like the way that
 

1293
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,149
reason why is cuz I like the way that
it's a massive dramatic video of her

1294
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
it's a massive dramatic video of her
 

1295
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,149
it's a massive dramatic video of her
holding it with a smile and then she

1296
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
holding it with a smile and then she
 

1297
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,149
holding it with a smile and then she
looks into the camera and then she shows

1298
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
looks into the camera and then she shows
 

1299
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,149
looks into the camera and then she shows
it the camera. So for me, I feel like

1300
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
it the camera. So for me, I feel like
 

1301
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,310
it the camera. So for me, I feel like
this is the strongest intro clip that I

1302
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
this is the strongest intro clip that I
 

1303
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,149
this is the strongest intro clip that I
can have. So that's why this is going to

1304
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
can have. So that's why this is going to
 

1305
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,909
can have. So that's why this is going to
be number one. Now what I need to do is

1306
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
be number one. Now what I need to do is
 

1307
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,909
be number one. Now what I need to do is
click on the clip, click audio, and turn

1308
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
click on the clip, click audio, and turn
 

1309
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,510
click on the clip, click audio, and turn
it all the way down and make sure the

1310
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
it all the way down and make sure the
 

1311
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,190
it all the way down and make sure the
fill buttons turned on because then

1312
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
fill buttons turned on because then
 

1313
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,029
fill buttons turned on because then
it'll make it fit the whole screen. Then

1314
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
it'll make it fit the whole screen. Then
 

1315
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,070
it'll make it fit the whole screen. Then
what we're going to do, guys, is we're

1316
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
what we're going to do, guys, is we're
 

1317
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,310
what we're going to do, guys, is we're
going to drag the voice over underneath.

1318
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
going to drag the voice over underneath.
 

1319
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,510
going to drag the voice over underneath.
We're going to play it with the voice

1320
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
We're going to play it with the voice
 

1321
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,990
We're going to play it with the voice
over. genuinely didn't expect this at

1322
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
over. genuinely didn't expect this at
 

1323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,789
over. genuinely didn't expect this at
all. I thought it was just flowers at

1324
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
all. I thought it was just flowers at
 

1325
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,350
all. I thought it was just flowers at
first, but then I realized it.

1326
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
first, but then I realized it.
 

1327
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,789
first, but then I realized it.
I genuinely didn't expect

1328
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
I genuinely didn't expect
 

1329
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,750
I genuinely didn't expect
>> I'm actually going to turn the voice

1330
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
>> I'm actually going to turn the voice
 

1331
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,270
>> I'm actually going to turn the voice
over down a little bit. It's quite loud.

1332
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
over down a little bit. It's quite loud.
 

1333
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,390
over down a little bit. It's quite loud.
So, we're going to change it by - 9 dB

1334
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
So, we're going to change it by - 9 dB
 

1335
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,149
So, we're going to change it by - 9 dB
and play it again. Now, this is a lot

1336
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
and play it again. Now, this is a lot
 

1337
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,909
and play it again. Now, this is a lot
better. So, now I can think logically

1338
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
better. So, now I can think logically
 

1339
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,110
better. So, now I can think logically
about what I want clip number two to be.

1340
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
about what I want clip number two to be.
 

1341
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,149
about what I want clip number two to be.
>> I genuinely didn't expect this at all. I

1345
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,350

1351
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,470
unboxing video number two because it's
her receiving the gift. I'm going to

1352
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
her receiving the gift. I'm going to
 

1353

make this fill. Going to go audio. We're
going to turn this one down and we're

>> Realized it's actually

1360
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240

 

1361

going to speed up. Actually, you know

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
going to speed up. Actually, you know

what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

1371
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,549
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
speed this one up. So, we're going to go

1372
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
speed this one up. So, we're going to go
 

1373
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,230
speed this one up. So, we're going to go
to speed. I'm going to go up by around

1374
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
to speed. I'm going to go up by around

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,470
to speed. I'm going to go up by around
about 1.5. And let's have a look at

1376
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
about 1.5. And let's have a look at
 

1377
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,590
about 1.5. And let's have a look at
this. Now,

1378
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
this. Now,
 

1379
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,630
this. Now,
>> I genuinely didn't expect this at all. I

1380
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
>> I genuinely didn't expect this at all. I
 

1381
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,510
>> I genuinely didn't expect this at all. I
thought it was just flowers at first,

1382
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
thought it was just flowers at first,
 

1383
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,390
thought it was just flowers at first,
but then I

1384
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
but then I
 

1385
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,750
but then I
>> I'm also going to speed this one up,

1386
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
>> I'm also going to speed this one up,
 

1387
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,830
>> I'm also going to speed this one up,
guys, by 1.5. I think all of these clips

1388
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
guys, by 1.5. I think all of these clips
 

1389
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,990
guys, by 1.5. I think all of these clips
need speeding up by 1.5 cuz they're a

1390
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
need speeding up by 1.5 cuz they're a
 

1391
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,230
need speeding up by 1.5 cuz they're a
little bit slow. Let's have a look

1392
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
little bit slow. Let's have a look
 

1393
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,750
little bit slow. Let's have a look
>> at first, but then I realized it's

1394
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
>> at first, but then I realized it's
 

1395
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,990
>> at first, but then I realized it's
actually a rose teddy.

1396
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
actually a rose teddy.
 

1397
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,510
actually a rose teddy.
>> See, that sounds really good. So, I like

1398
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
>> See, that sounds really good. So, I like
 

1399
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,510
>> See, that sounds really good. So, I like
to edit these clips as I'm listening to

1400
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
to edit these clips as I'm listening to
 

1401
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,430
to edit these clips as I'm listening to
them because then that way you get to

1402
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
them because then that way you get to
 

1403
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,270
them because then that way you get to
understand what should be placed at what

1404
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,280
understand what should be placed at what
 

1405
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,870
understand what should be placed at what
part of the video. So, I think that

1406
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
part of the video. So, I think that
 

1407
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,470
part of the video. So, I think that
looks really, really good

1408
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
looks really, really good
 

1409
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,549
looks really, really good
>> and it's so much more thoughtful.

1410

>> and it's so much more thoughtful.
 

1411
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,549
>> and it's so much more thoughtful.
>> So, now I want the boyfriend clip of her

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
>> So, now I want the boyfriend clip of her
 

1413
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,470
>> So, now I want the boyfriend clip of her
with her boyfriend. So, let's see if we

1414
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
with her boyfriend. So, let's see if we
 

1415
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,750
with her boyfriend. So, let's see if we
can find that. So, I'm going to drag the

1416
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
can find that. So, I'm going to drag the
 

1417
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,510
can find that. So, I'm going to drag the
one with her and a boyfriend in here.

1418
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
one with her and a boyfriend in here.
 

1419
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,870
one with her and a boyfriend in here.
And I'm also going to speed this up,

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
And I'm also going to speed this up,
 

1421
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,470
And I'm also going to speed this up,
guys, actually by two this time. So,

1422
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
guys, actually by two this time. So,
 

1423
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,750
guys, actually by two this time. So,
this one's quite a long video. So, I'm

1424
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
this one's quite a long video. So, I'm
 

1425
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,029
this one's quite a long video. So, I'm
going to go to speed. We're going to go

1426
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
going to go to speed. We're going to go
 

1427
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,549
going to go to speed. We're going to go
by two. I'm going to make sure this is

1428
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
by two. I'm going to make sure this is
 

1429
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,549
by two. I'm going to make sure this is
on fill. I'm also going to make sure the

1430
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
on fill. I'm also going to make sure the
 

1431
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,470
on fill. I'm also going to make sure the
audio is turned off.

1432
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
audio is turned off.
 

1433

down. It's a bit too quick. So, we're

1442
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
down. It's a bit too quick. So, we're
 

1443
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,310
down. It's a bit too quick. So, we're
going to go back to 1.5.

1453
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,070
the mirror shot of her in the mirror.
Okay, that one's the bad one. So, we're

1454
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
Okay, that one's the bad one. So, we're
 

1455
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,750
Okay, that one's the bad one. So, we're
not going to use that one. Actually, we

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
not going to use that one. Actually, we

not going to use that one. Actually, we
are going to use the mirror one. We just

1458

are going to use the mirror one. We just
 

1459
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,390
are going to use the mirror one. We just
need to crop it because the start of the

1460
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
need to crop it because the start of the
 

1461
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,909
need to crop it because the start of the
mirror one looks bad. She's not holding

mirror one looks bad. She's not holding
 

1463
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,750
mirror one looks bad. She's not holding
it. It looks fake. So, we're going to

1464
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
it. It looks fake. So, we're going to
 

1465
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,269
it. It looks fake. So, we're going to
crop it. So, her hands are now there.

1466
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
crop it. So, her hands are now there.
 

1467

So, her hands are on it. So, it looks
 

1469
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,950
So, her hands are on it. So, it looks
real. So, it's fine to be cropped there.

real. So, it's fine to be cropped there.
So, we can play it again

1472
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
So, we can play it again
 

1473
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,750
So, we can play it again

looking at it. So, like that's creepy.
So, we can just crop that down.

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
So, we can just crop that down.
 

1491
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,990
So, we can just crop that down.
>> It just

1494
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
>> And then we can play the next video. of
 

1495
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,070
>> And then we can play the next video. of
her on the bed with it. And we can speed

1496
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,080
her on the bed with it. And we can speed
 

1497
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,149
her on the bed with it. And we can speed
this one up definitely by 2.5 by 1.5.

1498
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
this one up definitely by 2.5 by 1.5.
 

1499
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,110
this one up definitely by 2.5 by 1.5.
And we can also turn the audio off. And

1500
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
And we can also turn the audio off. And
 

1501
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,029
And we can also turn the audio off. And
we can play it here. Oh, I need to turn

1502
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
we can play it here. Oh, I need to turn
 

1503
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,110
we can play it here. Oh, I need to turn
fill on. And then the last clip is her

1504
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
fill on. And then the last clip is her
 

1505
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,350
fill on. And then the last clip is her
holding it, presenting it to the camera,

1506
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
holding it, presenting it to the camera,
 

1507
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,549
holding it, presenting it to the camera,
which I believe is this one here. And we

1508
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
which I believe is this one here. And we
 

1509
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,029
which I believe is this one here. And we
can simply just speed this one up so it

1510
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
can simply just speed this one up so it
 

1511
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,230
can simply just speed this one up so it
matches the time of the ending, which I

1512
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
matches the time of the ending, which I
 

1513
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,710
matches the time of the ending, which I
think is 1.5. No, it's a little bit

1514
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
think is 1.5. No, it's a little bit
 

1515
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,710
think is 1.5. No, it's a little bit
less. So it' be 1.3. Okay. 1.2. Yeah,

1516
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
less. So it' be 1.3. Okay. 1.2. Yeah,
 

1517
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,549
less. So it' be 1.3. Okay. 1.2. Yeah,
1.2 is perfect. So, we can place it

1518
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
1.2 is perfect. So, we can place it
 

1519
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,190
1.2 is perfect. So, we can place it
here. Put this one on fill. Put the

1520
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
here. Put this one on fill. Put the
 

1521
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,070
here. Put this one on fill. Put the

>> Perfect.

1530
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
>> Perfect.
 

1531
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,990

>> Just like that, guys. We've got the

1534

>> Just like that, guys. We've got the
 

1535
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,710
>> Just like that, guys. We've got the
video made and I think that looks

1536
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
video made and I think that looks
 

1537
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,070
video made and I think that looks
really, really good. Now, the only thing

1538
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
really, really good. Now, the only thing
 

1539
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,070
really, really good. Now, the only thing
that I need to do is add captions. So,

1540
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
that I need to do is add captions. So,
 

1541
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,510
that I need to do is add captions. So,
we're going to go to captions,

1542
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
we're going to go to captions,
 

1543
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,750
we're going to go to captions,
autogenerate, click generate. Now,

1544
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
autogenerate, click generate. Now,
 

1545
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,750
autogenerate, click generate. Now,
usually it messes it up because it adds

1546
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
usually it messes it up because it adds
 

1547
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,430
usually it messes it up because it adds
like these double captions. So, the

1548
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
like these double captions. So, the
 

1549
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,190
like these double captions. So, the
bottom ones you can always delete. So,

1550
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
bottom ones you can always delete. So,
 

1551
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,710
bottom ones you can always delete. So,
the ones at the bottom, you can always

1552
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
the ones at the bottom, you can always
 

1553
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,070
the ones at the bottom, you can always
delete these ones, guys. You don't need

1554
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
delete these ones, guys. You don't need
 

1555
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,230
delete these ones, guys. You don't need
them. So, now I've deleted those. That's

1556
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
them. So, now I've deleted those. That's
 

1557
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,870
them. So, now I've deleted those. That's
fine. I can then go to basics. I can

1558
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
fine. I can then go to basics. I can
 

1559
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,430
fine. I can then go to basics. I can
change the preset to black. Actually,

1560
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
change the preset to black. Actually,
 

1561
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,750
change the preset to black. Actually,
I'm going to do white. And then basics.

1562
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
I'm going to do white. And then basics.
 

1563
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,430
I'm going to do white. And then basics.
We're going to make this bold. I'm going

1564
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
We're going to make this bold. I'm going
 

1565
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,390
We're going to make this bold. I'm going
to change the font to Poppins.

1566
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
to change the font to Poppins.
 

1567
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,630
to change the font to Poppins.
I'm going to unbold it. And then I'm

1568
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm going to unbold it. And then I'm
 

1569
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,830
I'm going to unbold it. And then I'm
going to make it slightly bigger. So,

1570
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,840
going to make it slightly bigger. So,
 

1571
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,590
going to make it slightly bigger. So,
we'll make it 12. And then I can make

1572
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
we'll make it 12. And then I can make
 

1573
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,909
we'll make it 12. And then I can make
this slightly bigger so it fits on one

1574
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
this slightly bigger so it fits on one
 

1575
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,990
this slightly bigger so it fits on one
line. And just like that, guys, I can

1576
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
line. And just like that, guys, I can
 

1577
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,830
line. And just like that, guys, I can
move the text up a little bit. And we

1578
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
move the text up a little bit. And we
 

1579
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,510
move the text up a little bit. And we
can play it. But before I play it, I

1580
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
can play it. But before I play it, I
 

1581
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,350
can play it. But before I play it, I
actually want to add music. So we're

1582
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
actually want to add music. So we're
 

1583
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,590
actually want to add music. So we're
going to go over to where it says audio.

1584
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
going to go over to where it says audio.
 

1585
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,750
going to go over to where it says audio.
We're going to click view all. I'm going

1586
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
We're going to click view all. I'm going

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,630
We're going to click view all. I'm going

1588
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640

 

1589
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,230

This one, actually, funny enough,

1590
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
This one, actually, funny enough,
 

1591
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,990
This one, actually, funny enough,
although it's the first one I chose, it

1592
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
although it's the first one I chose, it
 

1593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,430
although it's the first one I chose, it
sounds perfect for the video. It's got

1594
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
sounds perfect for the video. It's got
 

1595
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,750
sounds perfect for the video. It's got
like that romantic feel to it. So we're

1596
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
like that romantic feel to it. So we're
 

1597
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,269
like that romantic feel to it. So we're
going to drag this underneath. We're

1598
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
going to drag this underneath. We're
 

1599
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,549
going to drag this underneath. We're
going to quickly play it. But before I

1600
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
going to quickly play it. But before I
 

1601
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,510
going to quickly play it. But before I
play, I'm going to turn it down

1602
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
play, I'm going to turn it down
 

1603
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,669
play, I'm going to turn it down
slightly. So, let's turn it down by 10.

1604
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
slightly. So, let's turn it down by 10.
 

1605
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,630
slightly. So, let's turn it down by 10.
