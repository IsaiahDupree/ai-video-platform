00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,390
that we want. we have the the tones and
the color palette that we want from that

164
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
the color palette that we want from that
 

165
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,509
the color palette that we want from that
video. So, you kind of see the

166
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
video. So, you kind of see the
 

167
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,949
video. So, you kind of see the
difference. Now, when it comes to

168
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
difference. Now, when it comes to
 

169
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,350
difference. Now, when it comes to
structure of your prompts, these are the

170
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
structure of your prompts, these are the
 

171
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,110
structure of your prompts, these are the
things that I want you to include.

172
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
things that I want you to include.
 

173
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,070
things that I want you to include.

186
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
move? Number five, style. So, what
 

187
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,070
move? Number five, style. So, what
visual tone or genre you want to

188
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
visual tone or genre you want to
 

189
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,550

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
musthaves or things that you don't want
 

197
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,990
musthaves or things that you don't want
to include? And number eight is audio.

198
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
to include? And number eight is audio.
 

199
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,070
to include? And number eight is audio.
What should we hear? Now, a little trick

200
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
What should we hear? Now, a little trick
 

201
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,830
What should we hear? Now, a little trick
that you can use is use those eight

202
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
that you can use is use those eight
 

203
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,270
that you can use is use those eight
elements and feed them into chat GPT to

204
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
elements and feed them into chat GPT to
 

205
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,190
elements and feed them into chat GPT to
actually level up your prompts a lot

206
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
actually level up your prompts a lot
 

207
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,229
actually level up your prompts a lot
easier. So, you don't have to come up

208
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
easier. So, you don't have to come up
 

209
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,470
easier. So, you don't have to come up
with, you know, all these chat GPT to

210
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
with, you know, all these chat GPT to
 

211
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,550
with, you know, all these chat GPT to
actually level up your prompts. And you

212
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
actually level up your prompts. And you
 

213
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,910
actually level up your prompts. And you
can give it kind of like the scene that

214
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
can give it kind of like the scene that
 

215
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,750
can give it kind of like the scene that
you're trying to come up with. So you

216
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
you're trying to come up with. So you
 

217
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,229
you're trying to come up with. So you
can literally have ChadBt come up with

218
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
can literally have ChadBt come up with
 

219
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,990
can literally have ChadBt come up with
all the details, right? It's a little

220
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
all the details, right? It's a little
 

221
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,750
all the details, right? It's a little
bit of cheating, but look, we're all

222
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
bit of cheating, but look, we're all
 

223
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,030
bit of cheating, but look, we're all
doing it right now, right? So you can

224
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
doing it right now, right? So you can
 

225
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,630
doing it right now, right? So you can
use ChadBT to expand your base idea. So

226
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
use ChadBT to expand your base idea. So
 

227
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,310
use ChadBT to expand your base idea. So
you can start with something like, give

228
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
you can start with something like, give
 

229
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,789
you can start with something like, give
me a cinematic scene for a male model

230
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
me a cinematic scene for a male model
 

231
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,590
me a cinematic scene for a male model
wearing street wear in an urban setting,

232
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
wearing street wear in an urban setting,
 

233
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,830
wearing street wear in an urban setting,
right? Then you tweak the results. You

234
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
right? Then you tweak the results. You
 

235
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,150
right? Then you tweak the results. You
add sounds, adjust framing, describe the

236
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
add sounds, adjust framing, describe the
 

237
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,110
add sounds, adjust framing, describe the
lighting. You got to really think like a

238
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
lighting. You got to really think like a
 

239
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,350
lighting. You got to really think like a
director to some extent. Another bonus

240
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
director to some extent. Another bonus
 

241
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,150
director to some extent. Another bonus
that you can also do is before going

242
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
that you can also do is before going
 

243
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,909
that you can also do is before going
into VO3, you can use chat GPT or

244
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
into VO3, you can use chat GPT or
 

245
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,469
into VO3, you can use chat GPT or
MidJourney or any other image generator

246
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
MidJourney or any other image generator
 

247
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,030
MidJourney or any other image generator
and use the prompt, but instead of a

248
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
and use the prompt, but instead of a
 

249
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,710
and use the prompt, but instead of a
video, you're doing an image. So, at

250
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
video, you're doing an image. So, at
 

251
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,350
video, you're doing an image. So, at
least you can get a preview of the look

252
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
least you can get a preview of the look
 

253
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,629
least you can get a preview of the look
and really lock down the style down in

254
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
and really lock down the style down in
 

255
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,310
and really lock down the style down in
like the style references, right? So the

256
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
like the style references, right? So the
 

257
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,070
like the style references, right? So the
the you're building out the prompt, but

258
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
the you're building out the prompt, but
 

259
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,830
the you're building out the prompt, but
before you feed it into Gemini, you can

260
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
before you feed it into Gemini, you can
 

261
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,830
before you feed it into Gemini, you can
actually create images. So you'll be

262
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
actually create images. So you'll be
 

263
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,590
actually create images. So you'll be
able to tweak the prompt without using

264
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
able to tweak the prompt without using
 

265
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,950
able to tweak the prompt without using
credits or wasting a prompt on Gemini.

266
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
credits or wasting a prompt on Gemini.
 

267
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,710
credits or wasting a prompt on Gemini.
Now, I want you to remember this. You

268
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
Now, I want you to remember this. You
 

269
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,830
Now, I want you to remember this. You
only get 8 seconds out of these videos.

270
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
only get 8 seconds out of these videos.
 

271
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,070
only get 8 seconds out of these videos.
So you really want to use them wisely.

272
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
So you really want to use them wisely.
 

273
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,629
So you really want to use them wisely.
And to be honest, a lot of what you will

274
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
And to be honest, a lot of what you will
 

275
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,710
And to be honest, a lot of what you will
probably be using this, especially as

276
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
probably be using this, especially as
 

277
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,710
probably be using this, especially as
you're starting to to test it out,

278
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
you're starting to to test it out,
 

279
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,749
you're starting to to test it out,
right, is to use them as hooks, right?

280
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
right, is to use them as hooks, right?
 

281
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,150
right, is to use them as hooks, right?
is to hook the viewer in the first two

282
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
is to hook the viewer in the first two
 

283
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,670
is to hook the viewer in the first two
seconds. So, this is where you really

284
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
seconds. So, this is where you really
 

285
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,070
seconds. So, this is where you really
got to think about motion, contrast,

286
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
got to think about motion, contrast,
 

287
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,510
got to think about motion, contrast,
maybe humor, maybe a little bit of

288
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
maybe humor, maybe a little bit of
 

289
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,749
maybe humor, maybe a little bit of
mystery in there because then you can

290
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
mystery in there because then you can
 

291
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,110
mystery in there because then you can
combine that with something else. So,

292
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
combine that with something else. So,
 

293
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,629
combine that with something else. So,
for example, like you could do like a

294
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
for example, like you could do like a
 

295
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,350
for example, like you could do like a
skateboarder wearing a cargo joggers and

296
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
skateboarder wearing a cargo joggers and
 

297
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,430
skateboarder wearing a cargo joggers and
it does a trick over a puddle in slow

298
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
it does a trick over a puddle in slow
 

299
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,070
it does a trick over a puddle in slow
motion, right? The water splashes,

300
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
motion, right? The water splashes,
 

301
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,230
motion, right? The water splashes,
reflecting city lights, some night mode,

302
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
reflecting city lights, some night mode,
 

303
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,710
reflecting city lights, some night mode,
maybe some neon aesthetics. Audio is

304
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
maybe some neon aesthetics. Audio is
 

305
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,029
maybe some neon aesthetics. Audio is
maybe some hip-hop bead, the wheels

306
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
maybe some hip-hop bead, the wheels
 

307
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,110
maybe some hip-hop bead, the wheels
rolling, the splashing, right? That's

308
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
rolling, the splashing, right? That's
 

309
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,950
rolling, the splashing, right? That's
visual. That's visceral. That's like an

310
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
visual. That's visceral. That's like an
 

311
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,510
visual. That's visceral. That's like an
instant like thumb stopping content that

312
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
instant like thumb stopping content that
 

313
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,350
instant like thumb stopping content that
you would see on Tik Tok or or

314
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
you would see on Tik Tok or or
 

315
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,270
you would see on Tik Tok or or
Instagram. Now, this should enable you

316
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
Instagram. Now, this should enable you
 

317
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,629
Instagram. Now, this should enable you
to create variations of ads also very

318
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639

then again you definitely want to
 

479
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,430
then again you definitely want to
combine this with potentially other

480
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
combine this with potentially other
 

481
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,670
combine this with potentially other
scenes with potentially other content

482
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
scenes with potentially other content
 

483
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,509
scenes with potentially other content
maybe real content from your customers

484
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
maybe real content from your customers
 

485
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,670
maybe real content from your customers
and that's where the real magic happens.

486
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
and that's where the real magic happens.
 

487
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,670
and that's where the real magic happens.
Now this right here using Gemini we're

488
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
Now this right here using Gemini we're
 

489
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,470
Now this right here using Gemini we're
actually under a Google Workspace

490
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
actually under a Google Workspace
 

491
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,949
actually under a Google Workspace
account. So we have the pro enabled but

492
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
account. So we have the pro enabled but
 

493
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,030
account. So we have the pro enabled but
even with the pro there are limitations.

494
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
even with the pro there are limitations.
 

495
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,430
even with the pro there are limitations.
We've already reached the limit today on

496
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
We've already reached the limit today on
 

497
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,350
We've already reached the limit today on
creating videos. we have to wait till

498
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
creating videos. we have to wait till
 

499
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,670
creating videos. we have to wait till
tomorrow 8:00 a.m. in order to keep

500
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
tomorrow 8:00 a.m. in order to keep
 

501
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,670
tomorrow 8:00 a.m. in order to keep
creating videos. So, just know that us

502
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
creating videos. So, just know that us
 

503
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,269
creating videos. So, just know that us
as a pro account, we were able to create

504
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
as a pro account, we were able to create
 

505
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,790
as a pro account, we were able to create
about three videos and we've kind of

506
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
about three videos and we've kind of
 

507
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,470
about three videos and we've kind of
reached the limit for the day. I say

508
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
reached the limit for the day. I say
 

509
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,470
reached the limit for the day. I say
four videos and we reached the limit for

510
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
four videos and we reached the limit for
 

511
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,630
four videos and we reached the limit for
for the day. Beyond this, you can also,

512
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
for the day. Beyond this, you can also,
 

513
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,389
for the day. Beyond this, you can also,
you know, go into the next, which is the

514
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
you know, go into the next, which is the
 

515
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,470
you know, go into the next, which is the
AI, Google AI ultra is what they call

516
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
AI, Google AI ultra is what they call
 

517
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,070
AI, Google AI ultra is what they call
it, which obviously you get a bunch more

518
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
it, which obviously you get a bunch more
 

519
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,470
it, which obviously you get a bunch more
credits in the back end. Now, beyond

520
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
credits in the back end. Now, beyond
 

521
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,389
credits in the back end. Now, beyond
using Google Gemini, you could also use

522
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
using Google Gemini, you could also use
 

523
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,110
using Google Gemini, you could also use
Flow. So, this is a little bit newer,

524
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
Flow. So, this is a little bit newer,
 

525
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,750
Flow. So, this is a little bit newer,
but again, it uses the same technology.

526
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
but again, it uses the same technology.
 

527
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,750
but again, it uses the same technology.
It uses VO3, but with Flow, which I I'll

528
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
It uses VO3, but with Flow, which I I'll
 

529
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,829
It uses VO3, but with Flow, which I I'll
I'll warn you right now, we don't have

530
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
I'll warn you right now, we don't have
 

531
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,150
I'll warn you right now, we don't have
access to to this just yet because we

532
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
access to to this just yet because we
 

533
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,990
access to to this just yet because we
haven't upgraded our account. But with

534
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
haven't upgraded our account. But with
 

535
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,870
haven't upgraded our account. But with
Flow, what it allows you to do is be

536
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
Flow, what it allows you to do is be
 

537
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,430
Flow, what it allows you to do is be
more of a almost like a filmmaker. So,

538
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
more of a almost like a filmmaker. So,
 

539
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,790
more of a almost like a filmmaker. So,
if your plan is to potentially create a

540
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
if your plan is to potentially create a
 

541
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,190
if your plan is to potentially create a
a series, right, that you will upload as

542
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
a series, right, that you will upload as
 

543
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,910
a series, right, that you will upload as
Instagram reels and it's following this

544
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
Instagram reels and it's following this
 

545
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,829
Instagram reels and it's following this
character that you've created and this

546
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
character that you've created and this
 

547
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,870
character that you've created and this
character maybe goes on different

548
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
character maybe goes on different
 

549
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,230
character maybe goes on different
adventures and different things and you

550
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
adventures and different things and you
 

551
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,389
adventures and different things and you
want that consistency of that character

552
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
want that consistency of that character
 

553
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,990
want that consistency of that character
and sort of like this storytelling

554
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
and sort of like this storytelling
 

555
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,670
and sort of like this storytelling
aspect that maybe you're doing it to

556
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
aspect that maybe you're doing it to
 

557
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,190
aspect that maybe you're doing it to
entertain again, not necessarily

558
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
entertain again, not necessarily
 

559
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,790
entertain again, not necessarily
yourself, but to entertain your

560
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
yourself, but to entertain your
 

561
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,230
yourself, but to entertain your
audience. Doing something like that

562
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
audience. Doing something like that
 

563
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,630
audience. Doing something like that
would be a really great idea and very

564
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
would be a really great idea and very
 

565
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,230
would be a really great idea and very
easy to do with something like Google

566
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
easy to do with something like Google
 

567
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,670
easy to do with something like Google
Flow because Flow allows you to have

568
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
Flow because Flow allows you to have
 

569
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,430
Flow because Flow allows you to have
different scenes and cut up the scenes

570
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
different scenes and cut up the scenes
 

571
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,790
different scenes and cut up the scenes
together. It almost has like a like a

572
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
together. It almost has like a like a
 

573
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,190
together. It almost has like a like a
mini cap cut, you know, already built in

574
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
mini cap cut, you know, already built in
 

575
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,949
mini cap cut, you know, already built in
within here and allows you to combine

576
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
within here and allows you to combine
 

577
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,630
within here and allows you to combine
different scenes. It allows you to stay

578
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
different scenes. It allows you to stay
 

579
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,389
different scenes. It allows you to stay
consistent. It allows you to by default

580
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
consistent. It allows you to by default
 

581
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,389
consistent. It allows you to by default
add all the elements that you want. So,

582
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
add all the elements that you want. So,
 

583
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,150
add all the elements that you want. So,
we're talking about your product shots.

584
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
we're talking about your product shots.
 

585
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,590
we're talking about your product shots.
If you already have a model created, you

586
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
If you already have a model created, you
 

587
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,829
If you already have a model created, you
can add the model and it it it gives you

588
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
can add the model and it it it gives you
 

589
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,069
can add the model and it it it gives you
that consistency, that seamlessness and

590
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
that consistency, that seamlessness and
 

591
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,630
that consistency, that seamlessness and
still that cinematic look overall. So, I

592
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
still that cinematic look overall. So, I
 

593
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,990
still that cinematic look overall. So, I
would say this was made by filmmakers

594
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
would say this was made by filmmakers
 

595
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,790
would say this was made by filmmakers
alongside with Google to help generate

596
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
alongside with Google to help generate
 

597
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,430
alongside with Google to help generate
almost like mini movies, right? But you

598
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
almost like mini movies, right? But you
 

599
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,509
almost like mini movies, right? But you
can use it to do those types of things.

600
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
can use it to do those types of things.
 

601
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,630
can use it to do those types of things.
So, if you're interested in this,

Again, it's still using the same
technology, but with Flow, you have some
