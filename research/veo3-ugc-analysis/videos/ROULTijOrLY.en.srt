00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,750

Okay, so I just tested something that

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:01,760
Okay, so I just tested something that
 

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,750
Okay, so I just tested something that
completely blew my mind. I took viral

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
completely blew my mind. I took viral
 

5
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,510
completely blew my mind. I took viral
videos from Tik Tok and recreated them

6
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
videos from Tik Tok and recreated them
 

7
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,110
videos from Tik Tok and recreated them
with AI for different products in

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
with AI for different products in

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,190
with AI for different products in
literally minutes. No film crew, no

10
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
literally minutes. No film crew, no
 

11
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,190
literally minutes. No film crew, no
models, no editing, just AI doing

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
models, no editing, just AI doing
 

13
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,950
models, no editing, just AI doing
everything. And the results, I honestly

14
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
everything. And the results, I honestly
 

15
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,310
everything. And the results, I honestly
had to watch them twice because I

16
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
had to watch them twice because I
 

17
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,150
had to watch them twice because I
couldn't believe they were AI generated.

18
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
couldn't believe they were AI generated.
 

19
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,430
couldn't believe they were AI generated.
Look, I know what you're thinking right

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
Look, I know what you're thinking right
 

21
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,349
Look, I know what you're thinking right
now. This probably needs expensive

listen to me. I've been testing AI video

32
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
listen to me. I've been testing AI video
 

33
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,029
listen to me. I've been testing AI video
tools for over a year now. I've seen

00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
tools for over a year now. I've seen
 

35
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,190
tools for over a year now. I've seen
what works for viral UGC content and

because this is where it gets really
interesting. For my first test, I went

86
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
interesting. For my first test, I went
 

87
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,230
interesting. For my first test, I went
to Colada, a platform that tracks which

products are crushing it on Tik Tok
 

91
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,510
products are crushing it on Tik Tok
right now. It shows you which videos are

92
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
right now. It shows you which videos are
 

93
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,190
right now. It shows you which videos are
getting the most sales, which creators

94
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
getting the most sales, which creators
 

95
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,109
getting the most sales, which creators
are converting the best. I found these

96
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
are converting the best. I found these
 

97
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,870
are converting the best. I found these
jeans that were absolutely crushing it

98
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
jeans that were absolutely crushing it
 

99
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,789
jeans that were absolutely crushing it
this week. Then I grabbed a video from a

100
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
this week. Then I grabbed a video from a
 

101
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,310
this week. Then I grabbed a video from a
creator whose content was converting

102
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
creator whose content was converting
 

103
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,789
creator whose content was converting
like crazy based on actual sales data. I

104
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
like crazy based on actual sales data. I
 

105
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,630
like crazy based on actual sales data. I
uploaded the jeans photo as my product

106
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
uploaded the jeans photo as my product
 

107
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,870
uploaded the jeans photo as my product
image and her video as my reference. You

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,910
choose portrait or landscape format
depending on your platform. I went

00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
depending on your platform. I went
 

113
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,670
depending on your platform. I went
portrait for Tik Tok. Now watch what

114
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
portrait for Tik Tok. Now watch what
 

115
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,270
portrait for Tik Tok. Now watch what
happens. The AI starts creating what

different stages. First, it analyzed
 

123
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,990
different stages. First, it analyzed
your product just from the photo. It

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
your product just from the photo. It
 

125
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,510
your product just from the photo. It
creates a full comprehensive list of

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,830
about, who the target audience is, and
the key selling points. Next, this is

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,830
the key selling points. Next, this is
the genius part. It analyzes why the

the genius part. It analyzes why the
 

143
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,669
the genius part. It analyzes why the
reference video actually worked. It's

reference video actually worked. It's
 

145
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,350
reference video actually worked. It's
not just blindly copying. It's

146
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
not just blindly copying. It's
 

147
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,110
not just blindly copying. It's
understanding the psychology behind it.
