00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,829

So, right here is a video of a girl

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:01,839
So, right here is a video of a girl
 

3
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,830
So, right here is a video of a girl
making a simple review of some pants

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
making a simple review of some pants
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,590
making a simple review of some pants
that she bought online. And I thought to

6
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,600
that she bought online. And I thought to
 

7
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,269
that she bought online. And I thought to
myself, how can I recreate the same

8
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
myself, how can I recreate the same
 

9
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,270
myself, how can I recreate the same
video, but replace her outfit with my

10
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
video, but replace her outfit with my
 

11
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,110
video, but replace her outfit with my
own product like this? Or even change up

12
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
own product like this? Or even change up
 

13
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,470
own product like this? Or even change up
the background like this while

14
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
the background like this while
 

15
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,310
the background like this while
preserving the same exact movements.

16
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
preserving the same exact movements.
 

17
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,150
preserving the same exact movements.
This way, I have a fully unique video

18
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
This way, I have a fully unique video
 

19
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,910
This way, I have a fully unique video
that I can use for my own products.

20
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
that I can use for my own products.
 

21
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,189
that I can use for my own products.
Well, in this video, I'm going to show

22
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
Well, in this video, I'm going to show
 

23
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,670
Well, in this video, I'm going to show
you how this is done by using AI motion

24
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
you how this is done by using AI motion
 

25
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,109
you how this is done by using AI motion
control.

26
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119

 

27
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,550

So, you're probably wondering why would

28
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
So, you're probably wondering why would
 

29
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,470
So, you're probably wondering why would
you want to use AI motion control to

30
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
you want to use AI motion control to
 

31
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,470
you want to use AI motion control to
copy the same movements from other video

32
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
copy the same movements from other video
 

33
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,150
copy the same movements from other video
ads. Well, the first reason is because

34
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
ads. Well, the first reason is because
 

35
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,310
ads. Well, the first reason is because
we can use it to our advantage to copy

36
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
we can use it to our advantage to copy
 

37
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,069
we can use it to our advantage to copy
certain concepts that are proven to

38
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
certain concepts that are proven to
 

39
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,590
certain concepts that are proven to
work. So, for example, this is an ad

40
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
work. So, for example, this is an ad
 

41
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,430
work. So, for example, this is an ad
that's doing well for a brand called Oi

42
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
that's doing well for a brand called Oi
 

43
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,430
that's doing well for a brand called Oi
Rosie, and it's a simple 5-second video

44
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
Rosie, and it's a simple 5-second video
 

45
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,430
Rosie, and it's a simple 5-second video
of this girl doing specific movements

46
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
of this girl doing specific movements
 

47
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,030
of this girl doing specific movements
while she's wearing this dress. And what

48
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,040
while she's wearing this dress. And what
 

49
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,270
while she's wearing this dress. And what
we can do is use AI to copy the exact

50
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
we can do is use AI to copy the exact
 

51
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,110
we can do is use AI to copy the exact
same look of this video, replace it with

52
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
same look of this video, replace it with
 

53
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,790
same look of this video, replace it with
a different model who's wearing our

54
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
a different model who's wearing our
 

55
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,229
a different model who's wearing our
product, and then changing up the

56
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
product, and then changing up the
 

57
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,830
product, and then changing up the
background. This way, we end up with a

58
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
background. This way, we end up with a
 

59
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,430
background. This way, we end up with a
fully unique video that's not just

60
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
fully unique video that's not just
 

61
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
fully unique video that's not just
straight up copying the ad one for one,

62
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
straight up copying the ad one for one,
 

63
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,189
straight up copying the ad one for one,
but we're simply taking inspiration on

64
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
but we're simply taking inspiration on
 

65
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,029
but we're simply taking inspiration on
the motion. Not only that, we can also

66
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
the motion. Not only that, we can also
 

67
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,029
the motion. Not only that, we can also
spy on other competitors who are doing

68
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
spy on other competitors who are doing
 

69
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,630
spy on other competitors who are doing
extremely well, such as this men's

70
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
extremely well, such as this men's
 

71
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,910
extremely well, such as this men's
clothing store that's literally doing

72
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
clothing store that's literally doing
 

73
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,070
clothing store that's literally doing
like $10,000 per day. And what I could

74
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
like $10,000 per day. And what I could
 

75
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,429
like $10,000 per day. And what I could
do is look at all of their best

76
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
do is look at all of their best
 

77
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,109
do is look at all of their best
performing ads and we could take the

78
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
performing ads and we could take the
 

79
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,550
performing ads and we could take the
exact hook that they're using in their

80
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
exact hook that they're using in their
 

81
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,149
exact hook that they're using in their
video like this. Then take our own

82
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
video like this. Then take our own
 

83
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,070
video like this. Then take our own
product, put it on top of our own AI

84
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
product, put it on top of our own AI
 

85
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,830
product, put it on top of our own AI
model inside of their home, and we will

86
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
model inside of their home, and we will
 

87
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,510
model inside of their home, and we will
have our own unique version of a hook

88
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
have our own unique version of a hook
 

89
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,109
have our own unique version of a hook
that is proven to work from another

90
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
that is proven to work from another
 

91
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,550
that is proven to work from another
brand. And if you're still sleeping on

92
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
brand. And if you're still sleeping on
 

93
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,310
brand. And if you're still sleeping on
AI ads and you don't think they actually

94
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
AI ads and you don't think they actually
 

95
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,749
AI ads and you don't think they actually
work, here's the results of one of my

96
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
work, here's the results of one of my
 

97
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,749
work, here's the results of one of my
stores that I ran in Q4 that literally

98
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
stores that I ran in Q4 that literally
 

99
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,950
stores that I ran in Q4 that literally
did 130K off of one single AI ad. And

100
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
did 130K off of one single AI ad. And
 

101
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,390
did 130K off of one single AI ad. And
here's a Facebook campaign that I've

102
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
here's a Facebook campaign that I've
 

103
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,310
here's a Facebook campaign that I've
been using to test some new AI ads,

104
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
been using to test some new AI ads,
 

105
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,990
been using to test some new AI ads,
which has given me a pretty solid cost

106
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
which has given me a pretty solid cost
 

107
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,310
which has given me a pretty solid cost
per click of 86 cents and a nice rorowaz

108
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
per click of 86 cents and a nice rorowaz
 

109
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,950
per click of 86 cents and a nice rorowaz
of 2.17, giving this new store a net

110
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
of 2.17, giving this new store a net
 

111
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,069
of 2.17, giving this new store a net
profit of $445 in just the last week,

112
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
profit of $445 in just the last week,
 

113
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,590
profit of $445 in just the last week,
which I think is pretty good considering

114
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
which I think is pretty good considering
 

115
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,510
which I think is pretty good considering
that this is a new product test with a

116
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
that this is a new product test with a
 

117
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,190
that this is a new product test with a
new style of ads that I'm testing with

00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
new style of ads that I'm testing with
 

119

UGC content that we can model after. And
I'm just going to filter all of these

188
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm just going to filter all of these
 

189
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,470
I'm just going to filter all of these
videos by United States. I'm going to

190
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
videos by United States. I'm going to
 

191
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,150
videos by United States. I'm going to
select medium engagement so I know that

192
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
select medium engagement so I know that
 

193
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,670
select medium engagement so I know that
there's some traction with some of these

there's some traction with some of these
 

195
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,190
there's some traction with some of these
videos. And then I'm going to type in a

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
videos. And then I'm going to type in a
 

197
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,430

00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
videos have a really consistent motion
 

203
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,790
videos have a really consistent motion
that's going to work very well with

204
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
that's going to work very well with
 

205
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,470
that's going to work very well with
motion control. Now to get the best

206
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
motion control. Now to get the best
 

207
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,070
motion control. Now to get the best
results it's very important that you

208
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
results it's very important that you
 

209
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,750
results it's very important that you
find videos such as this one where

210
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
find videos such as this one where
 

211
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,750
find videos such as this one where
there's absolutely no cuts in between

212
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
there's absolutely no cuts in between
 

213
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,190
there's absolutely no cuts in between
the clips because if you find a video

214
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
the clips because if you find a video
 

215
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,790
the clips because if you find a video
with a ton of different cuts, it's just

216
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
with a ton of different cuts, it's just
 

217
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,229
with a ton of different cuts, it's just
going to mess everything up and you're

218
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
going to mess everything up and you're
 

219
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,589
going to mess everything up and you're
not going to get good results. So this

220
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
not going to get good results. So this
 

221
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,869
not going to get good results. So this
video that we're looking at right here

222
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
video that we're looking at right here
 

223
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,790
video that we're looking at right here
is the perfect example of what I like to

224
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
is the perfect example of what I like to
 

225
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,229
is the perfect example of what I like to
look for. And from the looks of it, I

226
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
look for. And from the looks of it, I
 

227
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,910
look for. And from the looks of it, I
think it's really successful cuz it has

228
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
think it's really successful cuz it has
 

229
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,830
think it's really successful cuz it has
literally 4 million views. If we get a

230
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
literally 4 million views. If we get a
 

231
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,430
literally 4 million views. If we get a
closer look, we can see the brand that's

232
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
closer look, we can see the brand that's
 

233
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,110
closer look, we can see the brand that's
actually behind this video ad. And this

234
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
actually behind this video ad. And this
 

235
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,790
actually behind this video ad. And this
brand is called Mother Denim. And I'm

236
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:26,800
brand is called Mother Denim. And I'm
 

237
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,470
brand is called Mother Denim. And I'm
just going to quickly copy the URL of

238
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
just going to quickly copy the URL of
 

239
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,990
just going to quickly copy the URL of
this brand just cuz I want to make sure

240
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
this brand just cuz I want to make sure
 

241
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,509
this brand just cuz I want to make sure
if they're actually successful or not.

242
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
if they're actually successful or not.
 

243
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,630
if they're actually successful or not.
So I'm just going to plug it into the

244
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
So I'm just going to plug it into the
 

245
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,470
So I'm just going to plug it into the
trending shops on Mana. And here we can

246
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
trending shops on Mana. And here we can
 

247
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,630
trending shops on Mana. And here we can
see that they're doing $11,000 per day

248
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
see that they're doing $11,000 per day
 

249
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,470
see that they're doing $11,000 per day
and they're doing around 400k visitors

250
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
and they're doing around 400k visitors
 

251
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,990
and they're doing around 400k visitors
per month, which pretty much tells me

252
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
per month, which pretty much tells me
 

253
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,509
per month, which pretty much tells me
that they're absolutely killing it. And

254
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
that they're absolutely killing it. And
 

255
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,270
that they're absolutely killing it. And
I know I definitely want to copy this ad

256
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
I know I definitely want to copy this ad
 

257
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,030
I know I definitely want to copy this ad
format for my own product. And then what

258
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
format for my own product. And then what
 

259
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,470
format for my own product. And then what
I'm going to do is just simply download

260
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
I'm going to do is just simply download
 

261
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,830
I'm going to do is just simply download
this video. Then we're going to open a

262
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
this video. Then we're going to open a
 

263
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,589
this video. Then we're going to open a
new window on chat GPT. And then I'm

264
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
new window on chat GPT. And then I'm
 

265
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,190
new window on chat GPT. And then I'm
going to drag that video over and then

266
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
going to drag that video over and then
 

267
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,670
going to drag that video over and then
simply say extract the first frame. And

268
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
simply say extract the first frame. And
 

269
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,869
simply say extract the first frame. And
after a few seconds, we're going to have

270
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
after a few seconds, we're going to have
 

271
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,390
after a few seconds, we're going to have
this downloadable link, which is going

272
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
this downloadable link, which is going
 

273
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,149
this downloadable link, which is going
to give us the very first frame from

274
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
to give us the very first frame from
 

275
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,830
to give us the very first frame from
that video we want to copy. And the

276
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
that video we want to copy. And the
 

277
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,110
that video we want to copy. And the
reason I'm doing this is so that we

278
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
reason I'm doing this is so that we
 

279
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,869
reason I'm doing this is so that we
could take the exact same angle of that

280
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
could take the exact same angle of that
 

281
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,470
could take the exact same angle of that
photo, but replace it with our own

282
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
photo, but replace it with our own
 

283
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,990
photo, but replace it with our own
product just like this. So to make this

284
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
product just like this. So to make this
 

285
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,750
product just like this. So to make this
work, you just want to get my GPT in the

286
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
work, you just want to get my GPT in the
 

287
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,190
work, you just want to get my GPT in the
description below, which is completely

288
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
description below, which is completely
 

289
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,390
description below, which is completely
for free. And what I'm going to do is

290
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
for free. And what I'm going to do is
 

291
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,990
for free. And what I'm going to do is
just upload that first frame that we

292
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
just upload that first frame that we
 

293
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,270
just upload that first frame that we
just downloaded earlier. And let's

294
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
just downloaded earlier. And let's
 

295
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,710
just downloaded earlier. And let's
assume that this is the product that I'm

296
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
assume that this is the product that I'm
 

297
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,229
assume that this is the product that I'm
selling on my store and I want this

298
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
selling on my store and I want this
 

299
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,749
selling on my store and I want this
model to be wearing it. Then I'm simply

300
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
model to be wearing it. Then I'm simply
 

301
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,030
model to be wearing it. Then I'm simply
just going to take a screenshot of that

302
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
just going to take a screenshot of that
 

303
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,390
just going to take a screenshot of that
and then I'm also going to upload it

304
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
and then I'm also going to upload it
 

305
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,310
and then I'm also going to upload it
directly into chat GPT. And then I just

306
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
directly into chat GPT. And then I just
 

307
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,830
directly into chat GPT. And then I just
wrote out this very simple prompt where

308
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
wrote out this very simple prompt where
 

309
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,830
wrote out this very simple prompt where
I say create an image prompt cloning the

310
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
I say create an image prompt cloning the
 

311
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,510
I say create an image prompt cloning the
first image but replacing her clothes

312
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
first image but replacing her clothes
 

313
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,950
first image but replacing her clothes

seconds, we now have a full prompt that

316
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
seconds, we now have a full prompt that
 

317
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,150
seconds, we now have a full prompt that
we can either copy and paste into

we can either copy and paste into
 

319
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,990
we can either copy and paste into
chatbt. But me personally, I'm going to

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
chatbt. But me personally, I'm going to
 

321
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,909
chatbt. But me personally, I'm going to
use Google Gemini, which I think is the

322
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
use Google Gemini, which I think is the
 

323
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,670
use Google Gemini, which I think is the
best image generator out right now. So

324
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
best image generator out right now. So
 

325
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,950
best image generator out right now. So
we're going to paste in that prompt. And

326
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
we're going to paste in that prompt. And
 

327
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,310
we're going to paste in that prompt. And
then I'm going to upload the first frame

328
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
then I'm going to upload the first frame
 

329

looks pretty much identical to the very
first frame that we extracted. And now

350
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
first frame that we extracted. And now
 

351
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,430
first frame that we extracted. And now
all we have to do from here is apply

all we have to do from here is apply
 

353

that's pretty much all we need to do
 

415
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,270
that's pretty much all we need to do

any differences in results when I do
 

421
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,550
any differences in results when I do
that. And I also recommend checking this

422
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
that. And I also recommend checking this
 

423
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,550
that. And I also recommend checking this
box that says character orientation

424
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
box that says character orientation
 

425
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,230
box that says character orientation
matches video. And then down here, we

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
matches video. And then down here, we
 

427
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,510
matches video. And then down here, we
have the ability to select different

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
have the ability to select different
 

429
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,790
have the ability to select different
qualities. I would just recommend

430
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
qualities. I would just recommend
 

431
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,629
qualities. I would just recommend
sticking with 720p so that you can

432
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
sticking with 720p so that you can
 

433
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,309
sticking with 720p so that you can
conserve your credits. Only select one

434
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
conserve your credits. Only select one
 

435
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,830
conserve your credits. Only select one
output and you can choose whether you

436
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
output and you can choose whether you
 

437
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,430
output and you can choose whether you
want to preserve the same audio from

438
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
want to preserve the same audio from
 

439
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,189
want to preserve the same audio from
your source clip or not. And here's the

440
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
your source clip or not. And here's the
 

441
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,790
your source clip or not. And here's the
results of how this clip came out. And

442
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
results of how this clip came out. And
 

443
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,309
results of how this clip came out. And
you can see that it looks insanely

444
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
you can see that it looks insanely
 

445
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,909
you can see that it looks insanely
realistic and it's pretty insane how

446
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
realistic and it's pretty insane how
 

447
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,830
realistic and it's pretty insane how
it's copying the exact same movements

448
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
it's copying the exact same movements
 

449
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,150
it's copying the exact same movements
and still preserving this mirror very

450
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
and still preserving this mirror very
 

451
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,909
and still preserving this mirror very
accurately just like in the original

00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
accurately just like in the original
 

453
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,590
accurately just like in the original
video. Now, keep in mind that this is

454
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
video. Now, keep in mind that this is
 

455
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,189
video. Now, keep in mind that this is
just an example and I would never

00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
just an example and I would never
 

457
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,270
just an example and I would never

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,270
recommend running an ad using the exact
same background as your source footage.

460
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
same background as your source footage.
 

461

Love how it's kind of belted here and

because you could put your actor in

482
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
because you could put your actor in
 

483
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,510
because you could put your actor in
whatever setting that you want, such as

484
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
whatever setting that you want, such as
 

485
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,350
whatever setting that you want, such as
outer space or even in the middle of

486
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
outer space or even in the middle of
 

487
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,350
outer space or even in the middle of
Antarctica. So, as you can see, it's not

488
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
Antarctica. So, as you can see, it's not
 

489
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,029
Antarctica. So, as you can see, it's not
really hard to do. And now I'm going to

490
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
really hard to do. And now I'm going to
 

491
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,710
really hard to do. And now I'm going to
show you just a couple of more use cases

492
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
show you just a couple of more use cases
 

493
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,070
show you just a couple of more use cases
on how you can use this for your

494
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
on how you can use this for your
 

495
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,350
on how you can use this for your
advantage. So, let's say I'm selling

496
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
advantage. So, let's say I'm selling
 

497
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,029
advantage. So, let's say I'm selling
these pair of jeans on my store and I

498
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
these pair of jeans on my store and I
 

499
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,110
these pair of jeans on my store and I
want to copy an ad with a proven format

500
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
want to copy an ad with a proven format
 

501
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,629
want to copy an ad with a proven format
while wearing these jeans. I could just

502
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
while wearing these jeans. I could just
 

503
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,309
while wearing these jeans. I could just
go back into Mana, filter all of these

504
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
go back into Mana, filter all of these
 

505
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,150
go back into Mana, filter all of these
Facebook ads by videos only, and I want

506
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
Facebook ads by videos only, and I want
 

507
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,510
Facebook ads by videos only, and I want
to make sure that all of these ads are

508
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
to make sure that all of these ads are
 

509
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,029
to make sure that all of these ads are
still active. And then to narrow it down

510
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
still active. And then to narrow it down
 

511
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,550
still active. And then to narrow it down
further so I can find what I actually

512
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
further so I can find what I actually
 

513
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,230
further so I can find what I actually
want, I'm going to type in pants. This

514
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
want, I'm going to type in pants. This
 

515
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,309
want, I'm going to type in pants. This
way, I have access and inspiration of

516
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
way, I have access and inspiration of
 

517
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,469
way, I have access and inspiration of
all the ads that are advertising a pair

518
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
all the ads that are advertising a pair
 

519
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,990
all the ads that are advertising a pair
of pants. And for example, let's just

520
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
of pants. And for example, let's just
 

521
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,430
of pants. And for example, let's just
take a look at this ad and see what

522
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
take a look at this ad and see what
 

523
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,790
take a look at this ad and see what
she's doing. So, you can see it's really

524
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
she's doing. So, you can see it's really
 

525
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,469
she's doing. So, you can see it's really
simple. This girl is just backing up and

526
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
simple. This girl is just backing up and
 

527
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,990
simple. This girl is just backing up and
then showing the features of the pants.

528
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
then showing the features of the pants.
 

529
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,350
then showing the features of the pants.
But let's just assume that this was

530
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
But let's just assume that this was
 

531
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,029
But let's just assume that this was
actually an ad concept that was working

532
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
actually an ad concept that was working
 

533
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,550
actually an ad concept that was working
extremely well. Let me show you how we

534
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
extremely well. Let me show you how we
 

535
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,230
extremely well. Let me show you how we
can easily recreate this using motion

536
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
can easily recreate this using motion
 

537
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,510
can easily recreate this using motion
control. So once again, I'm just going

538
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
control. So once again, I'm just going
 

539
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,029
control. So once again, I'm just going
to download this video clip. Then we're

540
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
to download this video clip. Then we're
 

541
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,710
to download this video clip. Then we're
going to take it over to Chat GBT. Then

542
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
going to take it over to Chat GBT. Then
 

543
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,469
going to take it over to Chat GBT. Then
I'm going to tell it to extract the very

544
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
I'm going to tell it to extract the very
 

545
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,070
I'm going to tell it to extract the very
first frame. And here's how that photo

546
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
first frame. And here's how that photo
 

547
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,670
first frame. And here's how that photo
turned out. And then just like before, I

548
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
turned out. And then just like before, I
 

549
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,350
turned out. And then just like before, I
just uploaded that first frame and then

550
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
just uploaded that first frame and then
 

551
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,950
just uploaded that first frame and then
a picture of the jeans that I'm selling.

552
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
a picture of the jeans that I'm selling.
 

553
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,390
a picture of the jeans that I'm selling.
And then I simply said to clone the

554
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
And then I simply said to clone the
 

555
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,990
And then I simply said to clone the
image and replace her pants with those

556
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
image and replace her pants with those
 

557
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,270
image and replace her pants with those
jeans. And then it gave me the full

558
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
jeans. And then it gave me the full
 

559
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,110
jeans. And then it gave me the full
prompt once again. However, I added a

560
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
prompt once again. However, I added a
 

561
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,629
prompt once again. However, I added a
slight twist where I wanted to change

562
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
slight twist where I wanted to change
 

563
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,309
slight twist where I wanted to change
the way the actor looks while still

564
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
the way the actor looks while still
 

565
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,150
the way the actor looks while still
preserving the exact same pose. And then

566
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
preserving the exact same pose. And then
 

567
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,909
preserving the exact same pose. And then
it ended up giving me this exact prompt

568
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
it ended up giving me this exact prompt
 

569
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,270
it ended up giving me this exact prompt
right here. And then after putting that

570
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
right here. And then after putting that
 

571
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,110
right here. And then after putting that
prompt into Gemini, this is the exact

572
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
prompt into Gemini, this is the exact
 

573
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,710
prompt into Gemini, this is the exact
result that I was able to get, which

574
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
result that I was able to get, which
 

575
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,390
result that I was able to get, which
looks really spot-on. And then I just

576
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
looks really spot-on. And then I just
 

577
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,909
looks really spot-on. And then I just
uploaded the base clip like I did

578
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
uploaded the base clip like I did
 

579
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,510
uploaded the base clip like I did
before. Uploaded that image of that

580
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
before. Uploaded that image of that
 

581
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,029
before. Uploaded that image of that
blonde girl wearing the jeans. And

582
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
blonde girl wearing the jeans. And
 

583
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,390
blonde girl wearing the jeans. And
here's how the video looks like after

584
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
here's how the video looks like after
 

585
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,230
here's how the video looks like after
swapping out the background. This way we

586
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
swapping out the background. This way we
 

587
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,230
swapping out the background. This way we
have a fully unique video with our own

588
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
have a fully unique video with our own
 

589
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,309
have a fully unique video with our own
model, our own product, and using the

590
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
model, our own product, and using the
 

591
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,150
model, our own product, and using the
motion as inspiration. Now, the only

592
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
motion as inspiration. Now, the only
 

593
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,670
motion as inspiration. Now, the only
slight issue is that this girl is

594
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
slight issue is that this girl is
 

595
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,270
slight issue is that this girl is
talking and it's going to use the audio

596
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
talking and it's going to use the audio
 

597
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,029
talking and it's going to use the audio
from the original footage, which is not

598
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
from the original footage, which is not
 

599
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,309
from the original footage, which is not
going to look right. So, the only

600
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
going to look right. So, the only
 

601
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,830
going to look right. So, the only
solution would be to use something like

602
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
solution would be to use something like
 

603
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,990
solution would be to use something like
11 Labs to generate our own voice and

604
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
11 Labs to generate our own voice and
 

605
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,230
11 Labs to generate our own voice and
then use a tool like sync.so to sync

606
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
then use a tool like sync.so to sync
 

607
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,149
then use a tool like sync.so to sync
that new voice on top of her lips. This

608
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
that new voice on top of her lips. This
 

609
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,990
that new voice on top of her lips. This
way, we can actually run it as an ad.

610
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
way, we can actually run it as an ad.
 

611
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,829
way, we can actually run it as an ad.
