00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
each note so that you can also
 

163
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,790
each note so that you can also
understand the principles of creating

164
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
understand the principles of creating
 

165
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,110
understand the principles of creating
automations and AI systems like this one

166
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
automations and AI systems like this one
 

167
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,869
automations and AI systems like this one
that I'm about to show you. But cool,

168
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
that I'm about to show you. But cool,
 

169
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,790
that I'm about to show you. But cool,
let's dive into this. So essentially

170
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
let's dive into this. So essentially
 

171
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,350
let's dive into this. So essentially
this AI system, the way that you use it

172
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
this AI system, the way that you use it
 

173
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,430
this AI system, the way that you use it
is sort of like a mini application. So

174
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
is sort of like a mini application. So
 

175
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,670
is sort of like a mini application. So
whenever you need, let's say, UGC ads or

176
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
whenever you need, let's say, UGC ads or
 

177
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,430
whenever you need, let's say, UGC ads or
content for your product or for your

178
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
content for your product or for your
 

179
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,350
content for your product or for your
client's product, what you do is you go

180
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
client's product, what you do is you go
 

181
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,869
client's product, what you do is you go
in here and the only thing that you need

182
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
in here and the only thing that you need
 

183
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,190
in here and the only thing that you need
to tweak would be this node right here,

184
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
to tweak would be this node right here,
 

185
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,190
to tweak would be this node right here,
which is the creative brief because if

186
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
which is the creative brief because if
 

187
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,589
which is the creative brief because if
we open that and if we just zoom in,

188
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
we open that and if we just zoom in,
 

189
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,430
we open that and if we just zoom in,
this is essentially where we provide all

190
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
this is essentially where we provide all
 

191
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,990
this is essentially where we provide all
of the building blocks for our AI agent

192
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
of the building blocks for our AI agent
 

193
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,790
of the building blocks for our AI agent
to create those UDC ads for us. So, at

194
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
to create those UDC ads for us. So, at
 

195
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,710
to create those UDC ads for us. So, at
the very top, we have here the field for

196
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
the very top, we have here the field for
 

197
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,550
the very top, we have here the field for
the reference image that we are going to

198
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
the reference image that we are going to
 

199
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,630
the reference image that we are going to
feed this model. And if we open this

200
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
feed this model. And if we open this
 

201
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,710
feed this model. And if we open this
link, essentially what you'll find is a

202
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
link, essentially what you'll find is a
 

203
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,550
link, essentially what you'll find is a
photo that I took of this Four Pines

204
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
photo that I took of this Four Pines
 

205
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,229
photo that I took of this Four Pines
Brewing Company beer, which we will be

206
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
Brewing Company beer, which we will be
 

207
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,390
Brewing Company beer, which we will be
using as a demo product for this

208
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
using as a demo product for this
 

209
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,070
using as a demo product for this
tutorial. And then if we just scroll

210
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
tutorial. And then if we just scroll
 

211
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,990
tutorial. And then if we just scroll
down here, there's just a few fields

212
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
down here, there's just a few fields
 

213
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,830
down here, there's just a few fields
around how many videos that you want.

214
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
around how many videos that you want.
 

215
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,750
around how many videos that you want.
So, for this run, we'll create three UGC

216
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
So, for this run, we'll create three UGC
 

217
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,190
So, for this run, we'll create three UGC
videos, although you can increase that

218
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
videos, although you can increase that
 

219
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,030
videos, although you can increase that
or make that into one. And then we have

220
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
or make that into one. And then we have
 

221
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,030
or make that into one. And then we have
this section for the dialogue. So, if

222
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
this section for the dialogue. So, if
 

223
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,710
this section for the dialogue. So, if
you have a specific script in mind, this

224
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
you have a specific script in mind, this
 

225
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,309
you have a specific script in mind, this
is where you put it. Or if you want the

226
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
is where you put it. Or if you want the
 

227
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,229
is where you put it. Or if you want the
agent to ideulate the script, you can

228
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
agent to ideulate the script, you can
 

229
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,309
agent to ideulate the script, you can
just direct it like so and the agent

230
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
just direct it like so and the agent
 

231
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,750
just direct it like so and the agent
will actually understand that. But for

232
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
will actually understand that. But for
 

233
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,589
will actually understand that. But for
this one, we'll just give it this

234
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
this one, we'll just give it this
 

235
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,589
this one, we'll just give it this
specific copy. And then the model, we

236
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
specific copy. And then the model, we
 

237
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,750
specific copy. And then the model, we
just set it as V3 fast, which is the

238
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
just set it as V3 fast, which is the
 

239
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,990
just set it as V3 fast, which is the
cheaper model between V3. And then we

240
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
cheaper model between V3. And then we
 

241
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,430
cheaper model between V3. And then we
just have a few more fields here, which

242
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
just have a few more fields here, which
 

243
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,949
just have a few more fields here, which
we'll go through in a bit around what

244
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
we'll go through in a bit around what
 

245
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,030
we'll go through in a bit around what
model to use and what aspect ratio to

246
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
model to use and what aspect ratio to
 

247
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,710
model to use and what aspect ratio to
deliver it as. And you'll see that is

248
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
deliver it as. And you'll see that is
 

249
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,710
deliver it as. And you'll see that is
vertical, and a free text field around

250
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
vertical, and a free text field around
 

251
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,470
vertical, and a free text field around
any special requests. And we'll go

252
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
any special requests. And we'll go
 

253
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,149
any special requests. And we'll go
through this together in a bit. But once

254
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
through this together in a bit. But once
 

255
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,110
through this together in a bit. But once
you have set these up on your side, that

256
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
you have set these up on your side, that
 

257
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,270
you have set these up on your side, that
is pretty much all the setup you need in

258
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
is pretty much all the setup you need in
 

259
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,309
is pretty much all the setup you need in
order to create those UGC ads. So now if

260
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
order to create those UGC ads. So now if
 

261
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,470
order to create those UGC ads. So now if
we execute this workflow, it will handle

262
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
we execute this workflow, it will handle
 

263
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,309
we execute this workflow, it will handle
all the technical heavy lifting for you

264
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
all the technical heavy lifting for you
 

265
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,390
all the technical heavy lifting for you
to create the prompts that you need for

266
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
to create the prompts that you need for
 

267
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,550
to create the prompts that you need for
those three or however many videos that

268
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
those three or however many videos that
 

269
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,630
those three or however many videos that
you want to create as well as the video

270
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
you want to create as well as the video
 

271
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,270
you want to create as well as the video
generation which this ads factory will

272
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
generation which this ads factory will
 

273
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,189
generation which this ads factory will
be handling automatically. So when that

274
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
be handling automatically. So when that
 

275
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,710
be handling automatically. So when that
workflow has finished, it will upload

276
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
workflow has finished, it will upload
 

277
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,469
workflow has finished, it will upload
all of your videos in the cloud storage

278
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
all of your videos in the cloud storage
 

279
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,909
all of your videos in the cloud storage
of your choice. For this one, we just

280
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
of your choice. For this one, we just
 

281
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,070
of your choice. For this one, we just
use box because it is quite easy to set

282
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
use box because it is quite easy to set
 

283
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,670
use box because it is quite easy to set
up. And if we go there, you can see that

284
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
up. And if we go there, you can see that
 

285
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,430
up. And if we go there, you can see that
we have those three videos now

286
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
we have those three videos now
 

287
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,590
we have those three videos now
generated. And this is just one of the

288
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
generated. And this is just one of the
 

289
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,150
generated. And this is just one of the
examples.

290
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
examples.
 

291
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,150
examples.

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
importantly, how does this whole thing
 

303
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,830
importantly, how does this whole thing
work? We basically have just one picture

312
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
want. Well, what we're going to do next
 

313
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,790
want. Well, what we're going to do next
is I'll just go through each of these

314
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
is I'll just go through each of these
 

315
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,150
is I'll just go through each of these
nodes so that you can also understand

316
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
nodes so that you can also understand
 

317
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,830
nodes so that you can also understand
the principles of how to set this up

318

00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,350
the principles of how to set this up
yourself as well as some of the thinking

320
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
yourself as well as some of the thinking
 

321
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,030
yourself as well as some of the thinking
and prompt engineering that went behind

322
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,040
and prompt engineering that went behind
 

323
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,189
and prompt engineering that went behind
this particularly for this AI agent

324
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
this particularly for this AI agent
 

325
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,710
this particularly for this AI agent
node. But very quickly, just the

326
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
node. But very quickly, just the
 

327
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,870
node. But very quickly, just the
structure of this workflow is quite

328
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
structure of this workflow is quite
 

329
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,790
structure of this workflow is quite
simple because like a lot of the

330
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
simple because like a lot of the
 

331
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,629
simple because like a lot of the
templates we showed here, we always have

332
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
templates we showed here, we always have
 

333
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,870
templates we showed here, we always have
this input section where we arrange the

334
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
this input section where we arrange the
 

335
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,670
this input section where we arrange the
elements for our AI agent to work with.

336
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
elements for our AI agent to work with.
 

337
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,749
elements for our AI agent to work with.
And then we have this configuration or

338
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
And then we have this configuration or
 

339
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,350
And then we have this configuration or
factory section where we create the

340
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
factory section where we create the
 

341
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,270
factory section where we create the
prompts here in this area. We pass it

342
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
prompts here in this area. We pass it
 

343
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,350
prompts here in this area. We pass it
along to our image and video generation

344
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
along to our image and video generation
 

345
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,749
along to our image and video generation
model and then out comes our output

346
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
model and then out comes our output
 

347
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,629
model and then out comes our output
which is the UGC video that we store in

348
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
which is the UGC video that we store in
 

349
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,790
which is the UGC video that we store in
box or whatever storage solution that

350
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
box or whatever storage solution that
 

351
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,550
box or whatever storage solution that
you are after. So starting with the

352
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
you are after. So starting with the
 

353
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,070
you are after. So starting with the
input section you can see that the

354
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
input section you can see that the
 

355
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,990
input section you can see that the
trigger here is manual and the reason

356
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
trigger here is manual and the reason
 

357
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,830
trigger here is manual and the reason
why that is is for a lot of these

358
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
why that is is for a lot of these
 

359
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,430
why that is is for a lot of these
creative workflows what we're actually

360
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
creative workflows what we're actually
 

361
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,510
creative workflows what we're actually
finding is that we're using them as sort

362
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
finding is that we're using them as sort
 

363
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,110
finding is that we're using them as sort
of like a mini application where

364
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
of like a mini application where
 

365
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,950
of like a mini application where
basically they generate the ads for us

366
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
basically they generate the ads for us
 

367
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,110
basically they generate the ads for us
on demand. You can obviously schedule

368
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
on demand. You can obviously schedule
 

369
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,790
on demand. You can obviously schedule
this and connect this whole thing to

370
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
this and connect this whole thing to
 

371
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,350
this and connect this whole thing to
autopublishing automations like blot

372
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
autopublishing automations like blot
 

373
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,110
autopublishing automations like blot
which we featured a lot in this channel

374
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
which we featured a lot in this channel
 

375
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,629
which we featured a lot in this channel
but at least for this case this is more

376
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
but at least for this case this is more
 

377
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,310
but at least for this case this is more
like a production machine rather than a

378
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,320
like a production machine rather than a
 

379
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,790
like a production machine rather than a
postcheduling workflow but anyway we

380
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
postcheduling workflow but anyway we
 

381
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,550
postcheduling workflow but anyway we
already went through this edit fields

382
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
already went through this edit fields
 

383
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,390
already went through this edit fields
node but just a couple of things that we

384
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
node but just a couple of things that we
 

385
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,629
node but just a couple of things that we
haven't covered in our demo earlier. So

386
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
haven't covered in our demo earlier. So
 

387
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,710
haven't covered in our demo earlier. So
if you open this and if you're new to NN

388
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
if you open this and if you're new to NN
 

389
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,309
if you open this and if you're new to NN
basically the way that this works is

390
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
basically the way that this works is
 

391
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,309
basically the way that this works is
there's always an input area here that

392
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
there's always an input area here that
 

393
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,749
there's always an input area here that
are all the data that's coming from

394
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
are all the data that's coming from
 

395
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,189
are all the data that's coming from
previous nodes. You have the

396
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
previous nodes. You have the
 

397
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,430
previous nodes. You have the
configuration of your node here and then

398
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
configuration of your node here and then
 

399
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,350
configuration of your node here and then
here at the right is the output section

400
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
here at the right is the output section
 

401
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,430
here at the right is the output section
which gives you a preview of the values

402
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
which gives you a preview of the values
 

403
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,510
which gives you a preview of the values
that this node is passing along to the

404
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
that this node is passing along to the
 

405
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,590
that this node is passing along to the
next ones. Now here as mentioned we have

406
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
next ones. Now here as mentioned we have
 

407
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,390
next ones. Now here as mentioned we have
the G drive link for the reference image

408
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
the G drive link for the reference image
 

409
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,469
the G drive link for the reference image
which as we showed is just a normal G

410
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
which as we showed is just a normal G
 

411
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,309
which as we showed is just a normal G
drive link. Now to set this up it's very

412
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
drive link. Now to set this up it's very
 

413
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,550
drive link. Now to set this up it's very
simple. So on your Google Drive you just

414
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
simple. So on your Google Drive you just
 

415
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,390
simple. So on your Google Drive you just
want to create a folder like what I did

416
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
want to create a folder like what I did
 

417
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,309
want to create a folder like what I did
here and then just make sure that you

418
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
here and then just make sure that you
 

419
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,950
here and then just make sure that you
share this whole folder for anyone with

420
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
share this whole folder for anyone with
 

421
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,870
share this whole folder for anyone with
the link. And the reason why you want

422
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
the link. And the reason why you want
 

423
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,189
the link. And the reason why you want
that is so that N8N can actually access

424
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
that is so that N8N can actually access
 

425
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,430
that is so that N8N can actually access
the images that you put in here. So you

426
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
the images that you put in here. So you
 

427
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,110
the images that you put in here. So you
can see that I have a couple of product

428
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
can see that I have a couple of product
 

429
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,189
can see that I have a couple of product
images that I took here as an example

430
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
images that I took here as an example
 

431
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,270
images that I took here as an example
and as a test. This is the one we were

432
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
and as a test. This is the one we were
 

433
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,029
and as a test. This is the one we were
using. And so all I did to get that link

434
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
using. And so all I did to get that link
 

435
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,110
using. And so all I did to get that link
is to just copy that link and place that

436
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
is to just copy that link and place that
 

437
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,510
is to just copy that link and place that
here. So that is very simple. And then

438
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
here. So that is very simple. And then
 

439
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,270
here. So that is very simple. And then
here we declare how many videos we need.

440
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
here we declare how many videos we need.
 

441
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,029
here we declare how many videos we need.
So for this run we've set it as three.

442
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
So for this run we've set it as three.
 

443
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,870
So for this run we've set it as three.
And then for the dialogue as mentioned

444
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
And then for the dialogue as mentioned
 

445
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,870
And then for the dialogue as mentioned
you can either have a specific dialogue

446
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
you can either have a specific dialogue
 

447
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,870
you can either have a specific dialogue
or you can also have your AI agent think

448
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
or you can also have your AI agent think
 

449
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,270
or you can also have your AI agent think
of the script for you. So in fact for

450
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
of the script for you. So in fact for
 

451
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,790
of the script for you. So in fact for
this walkth through let's do that. So

452
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
this walkth through let's do that. So
 

453
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,710
this walkth through let's do that. So
let's type something like please suggest

454
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
let's type something like please suggest
 

455
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,830
let's type something like please suggest
a script that will highlight this

456
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
a script that will highlight this
 

457
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,629
a script that will highlight this
product's fruity flavor. And that works

458
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
product's fruity flavor. And that works
 

459
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,070
product's fruity flavor. And that works
because when that's passed along to your

460
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
because when that's passed along to your
 

461
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,830
because when that's passed along to your
AI agent they'll be able to understand

462
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
AI agent they'll be able to understand
 

463
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,510
AI agent they'll be able to understand
that direction as well. Now for the

464
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
that direction as well. Now for the
 

465
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,110
that direction as well. Now for the
model again this is sort of like a free

466
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
model again this is sort of like a free
 

467
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
model again this is sort of like a free
text field because when we pass this

468
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
text field because when we pass this
 

469
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,870
text field because when we pass this
along to the AI agent all the agent

470
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
along to the AI agent all the agent
 

471
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,189
along to the AI agent all the agent
really is doing is to choose between V3

472
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
really is doing is to choose between V3
 

473
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,830
really is doing is to choose between V3
fast or V3 quality. And basically the

474
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
fast or V3 quality. And basically the
 

475
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,390
fast or V3 quality. And basically the
difference is V3 is a higher quality but

476
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
difference is V3 is a higher quality but
 

477
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,550
difference is V3 is a higher quality but
is five times more expensive. So with

478
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
is five times more expensive. So with
 

479
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,110
is five times more expensive. So with
the method we'll show V3 is actually $2

480
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
the method we'll show V3 is actually $2
 

481
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,230
the method we'll show V3 is actually $2
per video while VO3 fast is only 40

482
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
per video while VO3 fast is only 40
 

483
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,469
per video while VO3 fast is only 40
cents for that 8-second clip. And in my

484
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
cents for that 8-second clip. And in my
 

485
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,710
cents for that 8-second clip. And in my
experience V3 is not actually five times

486
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
experience V3 is not actually five times
 

487
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,870
experience V3 is not actually five times
better in quality. It's only marginally

488
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:50,880
better in quality. It's only marginally
 

489
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,189
better in quality. It's only marginally
better. So for a lot of use cases I

490
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
better. So for a lot of use cases I
 

491
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,830
better. So for a lot of use cases I
think V3 fast already is enough. So

492
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
think V3 fast already is enough. So
 

493
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,270
think V3 fast already is enough. So
we'll leave that be. And then for the

494
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
we'll leave that be. And then for the
 

495
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,150
we'll leave that be. And then for the
aspect ratio you can dictate this as

496
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
aspect ratio you can dictate this as
 

497
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,230
aspect ratio you can dictate this as
vertical. In fact, even if you tell it

498
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
vertical. In fact, even if you tell it
 

499
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,230
vertical. In fact, even if you tell it
as portrait, the agent will understand

500
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
as portrait, the agent will understand
 

501
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,390
as portrait, the agent will understand
it as well. Or you can also have this as

502
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
it as well. Or you can also have this as
 

503
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,990
it as well. Or you can also have this as
landscape. So just to be different,

504
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
landscape. So just to be different,
 

505
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,150
landscape. So just to be different,
let's do a landscape one for this

506
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
let's do a landscape one for this
 

507
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,670
let's do a landscape one for this
specific run. And then we have a free

508
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
specific run. And then we have a free
 

509
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,909
specific run. And then we have a free
text field here for any special requests

510
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
text field here for any special requests
 

511
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,909
text field here for any special requests
as I showed earlier. Now if we just

512
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
as I showed earlier. Now if we just
 

513
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,589
as I showed earlier. Now if we just
expand that, you'll see that we just

514
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
expand that, you'll see that we just
 

515
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,589
expand that, you'll see that we just
have a few inputs here where we're

516
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
have a few inputs here where we're
 

517
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,510
have a few inputs here where we're
saying that we want normal and casual

518
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
saying that we want normal and casual
 

519
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,110
saying that we want normal and casual
looking people. You can also define the

520
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
looking people. You can also define the
 

521
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,589
looking people. You can also define the
age range here and also have diversity

522
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
age range here and also have diversity
 

523
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,430
age range here and also have diversity
in the actor's gender. So this is the

524
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
in the actor's gender. So this is the
 

525
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,869
in the actor's gender. So this is the
area where you can have the freedom to

526
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
area where you can have the freedom to
 

527
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,469
area where you can have the freedom to
brief your agent with whatever that you

528
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
brief your agent with whatever that you
 

529
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,389
brief your agent with whatever that you
want. So for example, for this run, have

530
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
want. So for example, for this run, have
 

531
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,870
want. So for example, for this run, have
all of the actors

532
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
all of the actors
 

533
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,029
all of the actors
be in their cars. And then here I also

534
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
be in their cars. And then here I also
 

535
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,949
be in their cars. And then here I also
defined some common scenes when it comes

536
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
defined some common scenes when it comes
 

537
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,750
defined some common scenes when it comes
to UGC. You can opt not to have this or

538
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
to UGC. You can opt not to have this or
 

539
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,909
to UGC. You can opt not to have this or
also add a few more if you wish, but

540
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
also add a few more if you wish, but
 

541
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,269
also add a few more if you wish, but
you'll see that we just have a few

542
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
you'll see that we just have a few
 

543
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,030
you'll see that we just have a few
scenes here describing a person in a

544
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
scenes here describing a person in a
 

545
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,630
scenes here describing a person in a
podcast, person in their car, an

546
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
podcast, person in their car, an
 

547
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,630
podcast, person in their car, an
everyday mirror selfie, and so on and so

548
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
everyday mirror selfie, and so on and so
 

549
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,910
everyday mirror selfie, and so on and so
forth. So you can read through that in

550
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
forth. So you can read through that in
 

551
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,590
forth. So you can read through that in
your own time, but that's just a way for

552
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
your own time, but that's just a way for
 

553
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,630
your own time, but that's just a way for
us to give our agent an idea of what

554
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
us to give our agent an idea of what
 

555
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,630
us to give our agent an idea of what
we're looking for is what this edit

556
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
we're looking for is what this edit
 

557
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,389
we're looking for is what this edit
fields node is about. And so if we

558
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
fields node is about. And so if we
 

559
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,389
fields node is about. And so if we
execute this step, all that really does

560
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
execute this step, all that really does
 

561
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,470
execute this step, all that really does
is load all of that input data into its

562
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
is load all of that input data into its
 

563
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,070
is load all of that input data into its
run for this one. So if you go to

564
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
run for this one. So if you go to
 

565
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,230
run for this one. So if you go to
schema, everything here is just what we

566
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
schema, everything here is just what we
 

567
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,310
schema, everything here is just what we
defined for our agent. So that's pretty

568
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
defined for our agent. So that's pretty
 

569
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,470
defined for our agent. So that's pretty
good. So now if you click away, the next

570
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
good. So now if you click away, the next
 

571
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,430
good. So now if you click away, the next
node here is an analyze image node. So

572
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
node here is an analyze image node. So
 

573
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,949
node here is an analyze image node. So
if you open that, you can see we just

574
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
if you open that, you can see we just
 

575
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,630
if you open that, you can see we just
have it connected to our OpenAI account

576
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
have it connected to our OpenAI account
 

577
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,150
have it connected to our OpenAI account
as a credential which we've featured

578
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
as a credential which we've featured
 

579
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,990
as a credential which we've featured
several times in our channel how to do

580
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
several times in our channel how to do
 

581
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,750
several times in our channel how to do
that credential piece. And the operation

582
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
that credential piece. And the operation
 

583
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,910
that credential piece. And the operation
that we are doing here is for us to

584
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
that we are doing here is for us to
 

585
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,670
that we are doing here is for us to
analyze the image that we got from

586
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
analyze the image that we got from
 

587
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,350
analyze the image that we got from
Google Drive. And the reason why we're

588
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
Google Drive. And the reason why we're
 

589
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,110
Google Drive. And the reason why we're
doing that is because as of the moment

590
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
doing that is because as of the moment
 

591
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,590
doing that is because as of the moment
N8N's AI agent node cannot actually

592
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
N8N's AI agent node cannot actually
 

593
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,990
N8N's AI agent node cannot actually
understand images yet. And so we just

594
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
understand images yet. And so we just
 

595
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,910
understand images yet. And so we just
need this preceding node in order to

596
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
need this preceding node in order to
 

597
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,310
need this preceding node in order to
feed it information around the image or

598
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
feed it information around the image or
 

599
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,910
feed it information around the image or
the visual that we're passing it. So if

600
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
the visual that we're passing it. So if
 

601
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,590
the visual that we're passing it. So if
you look at the command we just gave it,

602
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
you look at the command we just gave it,
 

603
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,110
you look at the command we just gave it,
essentially we're just asking it to

604
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
essentially we're just asking it to
 

605
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,070
essentially we're just asking it to
return its analysis in a format that is

606
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
return its analysis in a format that is
 

607
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,230
return its analysis in a format that is
quite detailed. So we're asking ChachPT

608
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
quite detailed. So we're asking ChachPT
 

609
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,230
quite detailed. So we're asking ChachPT
to identify what the brand name is, what

610
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
to identify what the brand name is, what
 

611
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,470
to identify what the brand name is, what
the color scheme is, the font style,

612
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
the color scheme is, the font style,
 

613
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,470
the color scheme is, the font style,
what the visual description is of the

614
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
what the visual description is of the
 

615
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,470
what the visual description is of the
image we just passed along to it. And

616
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
image we just passed along to it. And
 

617
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,630
image we just passed along to it. And
here under the URL is where we pass

618
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
here under the URL is where we pass
 

619
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,790
here under the URL is where we pass
along that said image. Now you can see

620
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
along that said image. Now you can see
 

621
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,949
along that said image. Now you can see
that there's a bit of a character salad

622
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
that there's a bit of a character salad
 

623
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,550
that there's a bit of a character salad
here. And the reason why we need to do

624
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
here. And the reason why we need to do
 

625
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,949
here. And the reason why we need to do
that is because with Google Drive, this

626
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
that is because with Google Drive, this
 

627
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,829
that is because with Google Drive, this
link that you just gave N8N is actually

628
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
link that you just gave N8N is actually
 

629
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,590
link that you just gave N8N is actually
not going to function by itself because

630
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
not going to function by itself because
 

631
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,670
not going to function by itself because
it's not a direct download link. And so

632
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
it's not a direct download link. And so
 

633
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,910
it's not a direct download link. And so
all we are really doing here is provide

634
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
all we are really doing here is provide
 

635
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,389
all we are really doing here is provide
that special syntax for Google Drive. So

636
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
that special syntax for Google Drive. So
 

637
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,949
that special syntax for Google Drive. So
that we're simply getting the ID of this

638
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
that we're simply getting the ID of this
 

639
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,030
that we're simply getting the ID of this
particular image and as a result we get

640
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
particular image and as a result we get
 

641
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,590
particular image and as a result we get
this final URL which if you paste to

642
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
this final URL which if you paste to
 

643
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,870
this final URL which if you paste to
your browser that will just

644
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
your browser that will just
 

645
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,630
your browser that will just
automatically download that image which

646
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
automatically download that image which
 

647
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,230
automatically download that image which
if you look at it from N8N's point of

648
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
if you look at it from N8N's point of
 

649
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,470
if you look at it from N8N's point of
view that is what you need in order to

650
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
view that is what you need in order to
 

651
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,350
view that is what you need in order to
run this step. So if we execute this

652
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
run this step. So if we execute this
 

653
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,750
run this step. So if we execute this
step, what it's going to do is to look

654
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
step, what it's going to do is to look
 

655
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,310
step, what it's going to do is to look
at that four pines beer image. And as an

656
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
at that four pines beer image. And as an
 

657
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,110
at that four pines beer image. And as an
output, if we just go to the table view

658
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
output, if we just go to the table view
 

659
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,389
output, if we just go to the table view
and under the content, you can see here

660
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
and under the content, you can see here
 

661
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,910
and under the content, you can see here
that we now have that brand name loaded

662
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
that we now have that brand name loaded
 

663
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,550
that we now have that brand name loaded
into N8N in text format. It even gave us

664
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
into N8N in text format. It even gave us
 

665
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,790
into N8N in text format. It even gave us
the color palette in hex code, the font

666
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
the color palette in hex code, the font
 

667
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,790
the color palette in hex code, the font
style, and the visual description, which

668
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
style, and the visual description, which
 

669
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,269
style, and the visual description, which
is what we need to inform our agent of

670
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
is what we need to inform our agent of
 

671
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,990
is what we need to inform our agent of
what's going to happen next. So that is

672
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
what's going to happen next. So that is
 

673
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,670
what's going to happen next. So that is
basically all the input section now

674
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
basically all the input section now
 

675
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,470
basically all the input section now
done. Now all of the magic here mostly

676
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
done. Now all of the magic here mostly
 

677
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,790
done. Now all of the magic here mostly
happens with the AI agent and so this

678
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
happens with the AI agent and so this
 

679
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,190
happens with the AI agent and so this
node if you open it up you'll see that

680
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
node if you open it up you'll see that
 

681
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,269
node if you open it up you'll see that
with any AI agent you have a user prompt

682
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
with any AI agent you have a user prompt
 

683
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,949
with any AI agent you have a user prompt
which is sort of like what you send to

684
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
which is sort of like what you send to
 

685
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,870
which is sort of like what you send to
chat GPT and then you have a system

686
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
chat GPT and then you have a system
 

687
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,710
chat GPT and then you have a system
prompt which is sort of the underlying

688
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
prompt which is sort of the underlying
 

689
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,949
prompt which is sort of the underlying
instructions on how this agent behaves

690
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
instructions on how this agent behaves
 

691
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,310
instructions on how this agent behaves
and what its role in life is. So if we

692
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
and what its role in life is. So if we
 

693
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,470
and what its role in life is. So if we
just go to the user prompt and open that

694
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
just go to the user prompt and open that
 

695
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,470
just go to the user prompt and open that
you'll find that we gave it a task to

696
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
you'll find that we gave it a task to
 

697
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,150
you'll find that we gave it a task to
create an image and video prompt as

698
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
create an image and video prompt as
 

699
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,670
create an image and video prompt as
guided by your system guidelines which

700
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
guided by your system guidelines which
 

701
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,269
guided by your system guidelines which
we'll go through later. Now apart from

702
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
we'll go through later. Now apart from
 

703
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,829
we'll go through later. Now apart from
that we also gave it a few things which

704
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
that we also gave it a few things which
 

705
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,990
that we also gave it a few things which
we arranged for it neatly earlier. We

706
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
we arranged for it neatly earlier. We
 

707
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,150
we arranged for it neatly earlier. We
gave it the count of videos to create

708
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
gave it the count of videos to create
 

709
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,670
gave it the count of videos to create
and you can see all of these green

710
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
and you can see all of these green
 

711
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,590
and you can see all of these green
values which means they are dynamic

712
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
values which means they are dynamic
 

713
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,910
values which means they are dynamic
values and so this is mapping to how

714
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
values and so this is mapping to how
 

715
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,670
values and so this is mapping to how
many videos that you declared earlier

716
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
many videos that you declared earlier
 

717
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,829
many videos that you declared earlier
and so if you remember we declared three

718
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
and so if you remember we declared three
 

719
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,430
and so if you remember we declared three
videos there. We also gave it the

720
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
videos there. We also gave it the
 

721
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,590
videos there. We also gave it the
description of the reference image which

722
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
description of the reference image which
 

723
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,829
description of the reference image which
is coming from the previous step and you

724
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
is coming from the previous step and you
 

725
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,750
is coming from the previous step and you
can see how it translates here which is

726
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
can see how it translates here which is
 

727
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,829
can see how it translates here which is
what we just saw earlier and also gave

728
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
what we just saw earlier and also gave
 

729
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,069
what we just saw earlier and also gave
it the user's preferred aspect ratio,

730
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
it the user's preferred aspect ratio,
 

731
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,389
it the user's preferred aspect ratio,
the user's preferred model and dialogue

732
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
the user's preferred model and dialogue
 

733
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,550
the user's preferred model and dialogue
script and other special requests from

734
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
script and other special requests from
 

735
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,870
script and other special requests from
the user. So if you look at the

736
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
the user. So if you look at the
 

737
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,110
the user. So if you look at the
resulting values here for this run,

738
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
resulting values here for this run,
 

739
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,110
resulting values here for this run,
these are exactly what we declared

740
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
these are exactly what we declared
 

741
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,949
these are exactly what we declared
earlier. So we want a landscape video.

742
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
earlier. So we want a landscape video.
 

743
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,870
earlier. So we want a landscape video.
We want to use this model. We want it to

744
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
We want to use this model. We want it to
 

745
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,030
We want to use this model. We want it to
suggest a script. And finally a couple

746
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
suggest a script. And finally a couple
 

747
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,509
suggest a script. And finally a couple
of special requests that we declared

748
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
of special requests that we declared
 

749
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,990
of special requests that we declared
during that very first node. And so that

750
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
during that very first node. And so that
 

751
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,629
during that very first node. And so that
is our request. Now the system message

752
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
is our request. Now the system message
 

753
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,710
is our request. Now the system message
is the one that is basically dictating

754
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
is the one that is basically dictating
 

755
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,030
is the one that is basically dictating
how this model behaves. And this is

756
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
how this model behaves. And this is
 

757
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,949
how this model behaves. And this is
quite detailed. So I'll just go through

758
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
quite detailed. So I'll just go through
 

759
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,670
quite detailed. So I'll just go through
the specific points. But if you look at

760
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
the specific points. But if you look at
 

761
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,990
the specific points. But if you look at
this at the very top, we just have an

762
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
this at the very top, we just have an
 

763
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,230
this at the very top, we just have an
overarching direction here around it

764
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
overarching direction here around it
 

765
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,509
overarching direction here around it
being a UDC AI agent. what its task is,

766
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
being a UDC AI agent. what its task is,
 

767
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,030
being a UDC AI agent. what its task is,
which is basically taking the reference

768
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
which is basically taking the reference
 

769
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,629
which is basically taking the reference
image or the product in the reference

770
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
image or the product in the reference
 

771
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,790
image or the product in the reference
image and placing it into realistic

772
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
image and placing it into realistic
 

773
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,870
image and placing it into realistic
casual scenes and some extra guidelines

774
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
casual scenes and some extra guidelines
 

775
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,710
casual scenes and some extra guidelines
there in order to make it more natural.

776
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
there in order to make it more natural.
 

777
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,710
there in order to make it more natural.
Now, this part is important because if

778
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
Now, this part is important because if
 

779
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,509
Now, this part is important because if
you want a realistic looking video, you

780
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
you want a realistic looking video, you
 

781
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,670
you want a realistic looking video, you
actually need to add these sorts of

782
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
actually need to add these sorts of
 

783
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,150
actually need to add these sorts of
prompts like unremarkable amateur iPhone

784
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
prompts like unremarkable amateur iPhone
 

785
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,870
prompts like unremarkable amateur iPhone
photos or else it may look unrealistic

786
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
photos or else it may look unrealistic
 

787
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,949
photos or else it may look unrealistic
in the end. This is where we declare to

788
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
in the end. This is where we declare to
 

789
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,710
in the end. This is where we declare to
the agent that if the dialogue is not

790
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
the agent that if the dialogue is not
 

791
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,629
the agent that if the dialogue is not
provided then please generate that. So,

792
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
provided then please generate that. So,
 

793
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,150
provided then please generate that. So,
you'll see that in action in a bit. And

794
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
you'll see that in action in a bit. And
 

795
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,990
you'll see that in action in a bit. And
then we have a couple of guidelines here

796
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
then we have a couple of guidelines here
 

797
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,550
then we have a couple of guidelines here
because if you use an ellipses, that is

798
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
because if you use an ellipses, that is
 

799
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,190
because if you use an ellipses, that is
actually good in V3 to indicate pauses.

800
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
actually good in V3 to indicate pauses.
 

801
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,030
actually good in V3 to indicate pauses.
And if you have special characters like

802
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
And if you have special characters like
 

803
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,110
And if you have special characters like
m dashes or hyphens in the text, that

804
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
m dashes or hyphens in the text, that
 

805
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,710
m dashes or hyphens in the text, that
sometimes shows off the dialogue. So,

806
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
sometimes shows off the dialogue. So,
 

807
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,790
sometimes shows off the dialogue. So,
it's just good to make sure that the AI

808
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
it's just good to make sure that the AI
 

809
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,310
it's just good to make sure that the AI
agent doesn't include that in the

810
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
agent doesn't include that in the
 

811
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,990
agent doesn't include that in the
prompts. And then we also have an

812
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
prompts. And then we also have an
 

813
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,750
prompts. And then we also have an
avoidance for double quotes because that

814
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
avoidance for double quotes because that
 

815
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,590
avoidance for double quotes because that
introduces problems when we are

816
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
introduces problems when we are
 

817
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,829
introduces problems when we are
prompting with APIs. And then we have

818
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
prompting with APIs. And then we have
 

819
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,870
prompting with APIs. And then we have
here the agent framework of our ask

820
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
here the agent framework of our ask
 

821
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,389
here the agent framework of our ask
which we are just finding is good

822
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
which we are just finding is good
 

823
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,509
which we are just finding is good
practice when it comes to creating

824
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
practice when it comes to creating
 

825
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,190
practice when it comes to creating
system prompts. So we made a video of

826
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,200
system prompts. So we made a video of
 

827
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,949
system prompts. So we made a video of
that a few weeks ago if you're curious

828
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
that a few weeks ago if you're curious
 

829
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,470
that a few weeks ago if you're curious
about this topic. But basically what

830
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
about this topic. But basically what
 

831
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,629
about this topic. But basically what
that means is to provide an agent with

832
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
that means is to provide an agent with
 

833
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,150
that means is to provide an agent with
your ask which is what you want it to

834
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
your ask which is what you want it to
 

835
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,310
your ask which is what you want it to
output to you some guidance some

836
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
output to you some guidance some
 

837
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,949
output to you some guidance some
examples the notation which is important

838
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
examples the notation which is important
 

839
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,629
examples the notation which is important
so that the structure it provides you is

840
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
so that the structure it provides you is
 

841
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,790
so that the structure it provides you is
consistent as well as the tools that it

842
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
consistent as well as the tools that it
 

843
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,790
consistent as well as the tools that it
has access to. So just to point out some

844
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
has access to. So just to point out some
 

845
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,870
has access to. So just to point out some
of the ones that we haven't covered yet.

846
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
of the ones that we haven't covered yet.
 

847
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,710
of the ones that we haven't covered yet.
I think the ask is mostly the same. We

848
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
I think the ask is mostly the same. We
 

849
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,629
I think the ask is mostly the same. We
just added this scene count rule which

850
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
just added this scene count rule which
 

851
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,550
just added this scene count rule which
is basically accommodating for the fact

852
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
is basically accommodating for the fact
 

853
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,790
is basically accommodating for the fact
that maybe the user wants only one scene

854
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
that maybe the user wants only one scene
 

855
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,710
that maybe the user wants only one scene
or maybe three scenes or did not declare

856
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
or maybe three scenes or did not declare
 

857
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,470
or maybe three scenes or did not declare
anything at all. We provided it some

858
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
anything at all. We provided it some
 

859
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,629
anything at all. We provided it some
guidance which is mostly just a repeat

860
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
guidance which is mostly just a repeat
 

861
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,710
guidance which is mostly just a repeat
and a reinforcement of the ones we

862
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
and a reinforcement of the ones we
 

863
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,310
and a reinforcement of the ones we
highlighted at the top. And this one's

864
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
highlighted at the top. And this one's
 

865
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,710
highlighted at the top. And this one's
important some examples so that it knows

866
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
important some examples so that it knows
 

867
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,110
important some examples so that it knows
what we are looking for in terms of the

868
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
what we are looking for in terms of the
 

869
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,710
what we are looking for in terms of the
structure there. So you'll see that more

870
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
structure there. So you'll see that more
 

871
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,389
structure there. So you'll see that more
in a bit once we run this. And then the

872
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
in a bit once we run this. And then the
 

873
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,230
in a bit once we run this. And then the
notation, you can read this in your own

874
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
notation, you can read this in your own
 

875
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,389
notation, you can read this in your own
time. But basically what this is saying

876
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
time. But basically what this is saying
 

877
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,790
time. But basically what this is saying
is for each scene, please give us an

878
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
is for each scene, please give us an
 

879
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,110
is for each scene, please give us an
image prompt, a video prompt, the aspect

880
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
image prompt, a video prompt, the aspect
 

881
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,110
image prompt, a video prompt, the aspect
ratio for the video, which is either 9x6

882
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
ratio for the video, which is either 9x6
 

883
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,590
ratio for the video, which is either 9x6
or 16x9, and an aspect ratio for the

884
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
or 16x9, and an aspect ratio for the
 

885
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,829
or 16x9, and an aspect ratio for the
image, which is these values. So these

886
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
image, which is these values. So these
 

887
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,990
image, which is these values. So these
are coming from just the allowed values

888
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
are coming from just the allowed values
 

889
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,910
are coming from just the allowed values
of the image and video models we are

890
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
of the image and video models we are
 

891
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,509
of the image and video models we are
going to use. And this is also where the

892
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
going to use. And this is also where the
 

893
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,670
going to use. And this is also where the
model choices are declared. So that's

894
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
model choices are declared. So that's
 

895
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,189
model choices are declared. So that's
good. And then we just have the think

896
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
good. And then we just have the think
 

897
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,629
good. And then we just have the think
tool here, which you'll see in a bit.

898
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
tool here, which you'll see in a bit.
 

899
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,230
tool here, which you'll see in a bit.
Basically, that allows the agent to

900
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
Basically, that allows the agent to
 

901
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,710
Basically, that allows the agent to
doublech checkck its output before

902
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
doublech checkck its output before
 

903
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,710
doublech checkck its output before
giving it to you. So, very detailed

904
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
giving it to you. So, very detailed
 

905
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,710
giving it to you. So, very detailed
system prompt. That's what it takes in

906
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
system prompt. That's what it takes in
 

907
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,670
system prompt. That's what it takes in
order to make this agent really smart

908
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
order to make this agent really smart
 

909
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,470
order to make this agent really smart
and run on its own on autopilot. And if

910
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
and run on its own on autopilot. And if
 

911
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,310
and run on its own on autopilot. And if
you click away, you'll see that the

912
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
you click away, you'll see that the
 

913
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,230
you click away, you'll see that the
tools it has access to is pretty much

914
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
tools it has access to is pretty much
 

915
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,269
tools it has access to is pretty much
standard. We are just using GPT4.1. We

916
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
standard. We are just using GPT4.1. We
 

917
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,710
standard. We are just using GPT4.1. We
have the think tool that we referenced

918
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
have the think tool that we referenced
 

919
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,310
have the think tool that we referenced
earlier. Didn't really change anything

920
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
earlier. Didn't really change anything
 

921
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,670
earlier. Didn't really change anything
here. This is the default but just

922
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
here. This is the default but just
 

923
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,590
here. This is the default but just
adding it there will allow the agent to

924
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
adding it there will allow the agent to
 

925
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,269
adding it there will allow the agent to
sort of reason and think about its

926
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
sort of reason and think about its
 

927
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,750
sort of reason and think about its
output before finalizing it. And then

928
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:29,760
output before finalizing it. And then
 

929
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,269
output before finalizing it. And then
most importantly you have the structured

930
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
most importantly you have the structured
 

931
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,829
most importantly you have the structured
output which is where you declare that

932
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
output which is where you declare that
 

933
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,230
output which is where you declare that
final output structure that you want the

934
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
final output structure that you want the
 

935
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,910
final output structure that you want the
agent to adhere to. Right? So this is

936
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
agent to adhere to. Right? So this is
 

937
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,670
agent to adhere to. Right? So this is
just similar to what we went through in

938
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
just similar to what we went through in
 

939
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,150
just similar to what we went through in
that notation section. So lots of setup

940
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
that notation section. So lots of setup
 

941
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,750
that notation section. So lots of setup
and prompt engineering that happened

942
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:43,760
and prompt engineering that happened
 

943
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,990
and prompt engineering that happened
there. But now if we execute this step,

944
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
there. But now if we execute this step,
 

945
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,150
there. But now if we execute this step,
what it will basically do is take all of

946
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
what it will basically do is take all of
 

947
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,910
what it will basically do is take all of
the inputs that we so neatly arranged

948
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
the inputs that we so neatly arranged
 

949
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,230
the inputs that we so neatly arranged
for it. And now it is thinking through

950
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
for it. And now it is thinking through
 

951
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,310
for it. And now it is thinking through
what to do with those inputs using the

952
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
what to do with those inputs using the
 

953
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,110
what to do with those inputs using the
GPT4.1 model as its brain. And then you

954
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
GPT4.1 model as its brain. And then you
 

955
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,710
GPT4.1 model as its brain. And then you
can see it also used the structured

956
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
can see it also used the structured
 

957
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,269
can see it also used the structured
output subnode there in order to give us

958
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
output subnode there in order to give us
 

959
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,670
output subnode there in order to give us
these scenes. So if we go to schema,

960
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
these scenes. So if we go to schema,
 

961
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,749
these scenes. So if we go to schema,
you'll see that we have three scenes in

962
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
you'll see that we have three scenes in
 

963
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,550
you'll see that we have three scenes in
here. And then each of the scenes has an

964
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
here. And then each of the scenes has an
 

965
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,389
here. And then each of the scenes has an
image prompt where we see that the

966
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
image prompt where we see that the
 

967
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,710
image prompt where we see that the
character it chose is a 22 year old man

968
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
character it chose is a 22 year old man
 

969
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,110
character it chose is a 22 year old man
with medium brown skin and so on and a

970
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
with medium brown skin and so on and a
 

971
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,949
with medium brown skin and so on and a
setting because we declared everyone to

972
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
setting because we declared everyone to
 

973
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,269
setting because we declared everyone to
be in a car. This person will also be in

974
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
be in a car. This person will also be in
 

975
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,430
be in a car. This person will also be in
a park car during daytime and so on. We

976
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
a park car during daytime and so on. We
 

977
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,350
a park car during daytime and so on. We
have a video prompt here where it

978
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
have a video prompt here where it
 

979
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,870
have a video prompt here where it
suggested this dialogue. You can

980
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
suggested this dialogue. You can
 

981
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,470
suggested this dialogue. You can
actually taste the fruity stuff in this.

982
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
actually taste the fruity stuff in this.
 

983
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,069
actually taste the fruity stuff in this.
It's way more than your usual beer.

984
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
It's way more than your usual beer.
 

985
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,829
It's way more than your usual beer.
Honestly, I really like it. So that

986
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
Honestly, I really like it. So that
 

987
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,350
Honestly, I really like it. So that
sounds pretty good. And then you have

988
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
sounds pretty good. And then you have
 

989
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,110
sounds pretty good. And then you have
the aspect ratios here as well as the

990
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
the aspect ratios here as well as the
 

991
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,629
the aspect ratios here as well as the
model. And then you have the same thing

992
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
model. And then you have the same thing
 

993
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,550
model. And then you have the same thing
for the different scenes here, but this

994
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
for the different scenes here, but this
 

995
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,150
for the different scenes here, but this
time for different characters. So you

996
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
time for different characters. So you
 

997
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,389
time for different characters. So you
can see this is a 28-year-old white

998
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
can see this is a 28-year-old white
 

999
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,990
can see this is a 28-year-old white
non-binary person with short blonde

1000
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
non-binary person with short blonde
 

1001
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,430
non-binary person with short blonde
hair. So we'll see what that looks like

1002
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
hair. So we'll see what that looks like
 

1003
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,189
hair. So we'll see what that looks like
in a bit. But that's perfect. We now

1004
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
in a bit. But that's perfect. We now
 

1005
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,030
in a bit. But that's perfect. We now
have all of our prompts, right? So we're

1006
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
have all of our prompts, right? So we're
 

1007
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,870
have all of our prompts, right? So we're
ready to feed that into our models. But

1008
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
ready to feed that into our models. But
 

1009
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,870
ready to feed that into our models. But
before we do that, we just need this

1010
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
before we do that, we just need this
 

1011
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,749
before we do that, we just need this
split out node because if we open that,

1012
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
split out node because if we open that,
 

1013
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,150
split out node because if we open that,
you'll notice that these scenes are

1014
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
you'll notice that these scenes are
 

1015
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,790
you'll notice that these scenes are
existing in N8 ends run as one item. But

1016
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
existing in N8 ends run as one item. But
 

1017
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,509
existing in N8 ends run as one item. But
if you want to generate these videos one

1018
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
if you want to generate these videos one
 

1019
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,509
if you want to generate these videos one
by one, you actually need to pass them

1020
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
by one, you actually need to pass them
 

1021
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,669
by one, you actually need to pass them
along one by one as well. So our end in

1022
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
along one by one as well. So our end in
 

1023
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,669
along one by one as well. So our end in
mind here in the output is to have three

1024
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
mind here in the output is to have three
 

1025
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,069
mind here in the output is to have three
items where we basically just split out

1026
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
items where we basically just split out
 

1027
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,710
items where we basically just split out
these scenes into their individual

1028
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
these scenes into their individual
 

1029
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,870
these scenes into their individual
items. So very simple, we just added

1030
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
items. So very simple, we just added
 

1031
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,309
items. So very simple, we just added
split out. The only thing we defined

1032
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
split out. The only thing we defined
 

1033
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,309
split out. The only thing we defined
here is which field to split out, which

1034
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
here is which field to split out, which
 

1035
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,390
here is which field to split out, which
is basically the scenes group. So that's

1036
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
is basically the scenes group. So that's
 

1037
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,990
is basically the scenes group. So that's
what we'll be splitting out. And then if

1038
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
what we'll be splitting out. And then if
 

1039
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,669
what we'll be splitting out. And then if
you execute that step, all that really

1040
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
you execute that step, all that really
 

1041
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,270
you execute that step, all that really
did is to output those three items where

1042
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
did is to output those three items where
 

1043
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,750
did is to output those three items where
now if you go to the table view, you

1044
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
now if you go to the table view, you
 

1045
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,669
now if you go to the table view, you
have those same image and video prompts,

1046
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
have those same image and video prompts,
 

1047
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,070
have those same image and video prompts,
but you now have one, two, and three

1048
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
but you now have one, two, and three
 

1049
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,909
but you now have one, two, and three
items there. So that's perfect because

1050
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
items there. So that's perfect because
 

1051
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,669
items there. So that's perfect because
now we can proceed to actually

1052
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
now we can proceed to actually
 

1053
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,990
now we can proceed to actually
generating those videos. And the way

1054
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
generating those videos. And the way
 

1055
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,430
generating those videos. And the way
this is done is via two steps. First,

1056
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
this is done is via two steps. First,
 

1057
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,430
this is done is via two steps. First,
you generate the image to put those

1058
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
you generate the image to put those
 

1059
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,909
you generate the image to put those
characters that the AI agents chose with

1060
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
characters that the AI agents chose with
 

1061
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,830
characters that the AI agents chose with
the product that you gave it. And then

1062
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
the product that you gave it. And then
 

1063
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,150
the product that you gave it. And then
once those images are generated, we then

1064
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
once those images are generated, we then
 

1065
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,070
once those images are generated, we then
pass that along to our video model which

1066
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
pass that along to our video model which
 

1067
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,549
pass that along to our video model which
is V3 fast in this case via an

1068
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
is V3 fast in this case via an
 

1069
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,029
is V3 fast in this case via an
imagetovideo request so that we sort of

1070
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
imagetovideo request so that we sort of
 

1071
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,669
imagetovideo request so that we sort of
animate those videos including the

1072
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
animate those videos including the
 

1073
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,669
animate those videos including the
dialogue that we selected. So let's do

1074
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
dialogue that we selected. So let's do
 

1075
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,390
dialogue that we selected. So let's do
this. If we open create image, this node

1076
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
this. If we open create image, this node
 

1077
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,270
this. If we open create image, this node
is basically called an HTTP request node

1078
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
is basically called an HTTP request node
 

1079
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,750
is basically called an HTTP request node
because all it really does is request a

1080
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
because all it really does is request a
 

1081
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,549
because all it really does is request a
thirdparty tool or a thirdparty model to

1082
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
thirdparty tool or a thirdparty model to
 

1083
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,390
thirdparty tool or a thirdparty model to
do some sort of job for us. Which is why

1084
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
do some sort of job for us. Which is why
 

1085
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,230
do some sort of job for us. Which is why
you can see we set the method as post

1086
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
you can see we set the method as post
 

1087
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,990
you can see we set the method as post
because you're sort of like posting a

1088
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
because you're sort of like posting a
 

1089
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,510
because you're sort of like posting a
message. And if you're posting a

1090
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
message. And if you're posting a
 

1091
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,110
message. And if you're posting a
message, you need an address to do that.

1092
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
message, you need an address to do that.
 

1093
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,270
message, you need an address to do that.
And so this is that address. And you can

1094
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
And so this is that address. And you can
 

1095
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,470
And so this is that address. And you can
see that we are using OpenAI's GPT40

1096
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
see that we are using OpenAI's GPT40
 

1097
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,710
see that we are using OpenAI's GPT40
image model, sometimes called GPD image

1098
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
image model, sometimes called GPD image
 

1099
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,310
image model, sometimes called GPD image
one. But we're doing that via this

1100
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
one. But we're doing that via this
 

1101
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,470
one. But we're doing that via this
service called key.AI, which we featured

1102
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
service called key.AI, which we featured
 

1103
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,710
service called key.AI, which we featured
already a lot in this channel. But if

1104
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
already a lot in this channel. But if
 

1105
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,789
already a lot in this channel. But if
you look at key.ai, what they are is

1106
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
you look at key.ai, what they are is
 

1107
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,350
you look at key.ai, what they are is
basically an AI model aggregator. So

1108
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
basically an AI model aggregator. So
 

1109
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,789
basically an AI model aggregator. So
think of them as sort of like an app

1110
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
think of them as sort of like an app
 

1111
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,549
think of them as sort of like an app
store that makes it really easy for you

1112
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
store that makes it really easy for you
 

1113
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,630
store that makes it really easy for you
to access these models. So you can see

1114
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
to access these models. So you can see
 

1115
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,470
to access these models. So you can see
there's a lot of models here and the one

1116
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
there's a lot of models here and the one
 

1117
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,110
there's a lot of models here and the one
we're using is this 40 image API and

1118
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
we're using is this 40 image API and
 

1119
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,029
we're using is this 40 image API and
this is the address to request that

1120
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
this is the address to request that
 

1121
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,549
this is the address to request that
from. You can see we just have our

1122
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
from. You can see we just have our
 

1123
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,470
from. You can see we just have our
credentials set up here. So again we

1124
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
credentials set up here. So again we
 

1125
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,230
credentials set up here. So again we
featured that in previous videos or if

1126
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
featured that in previous videos or if
 

1127
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,590
featured that in previous videos or if
you're part of the community. You can

1128
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
you're part of the community. You can
 

1129
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,510
you're part of the community. You can
also learn how to do that in our setup

1130
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
also learn how to do that in our setup
 

1131
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,590
also learn how to do that in our setup
guide in our classroom section there.

1132
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
guide in our classroom section there.
 

1133
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,430
guide in our classroom section there.
But with every request you obviously

1134
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
But with every request you obviously
 

1135
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,350
But with every request you obviously
would need the body of that request. And

1136
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
would need the body of that request. And
 

1137
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,270
would need the body of that request. And
so this is where we define that and we

1138
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
so this is where we define that and we
 

1139
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,190
so this is where we define that and we
are defining that using the JavaScript

1140
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
are defining that using the JavaScript
 

1141
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,590
are defining that using the JavaScript
object notation format or JSON. All we

1142
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
object notation format or JSON. All we
 

1143
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,710
object notation format or JSON. All we
really have here is key AI's accepted

1144
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
really have here is key AI's accepted
 

1145
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,710
really have here is key AI's accepted
structure for a request which we got

1146
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
structure for a request which we got
 

1147
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,470
structure for a request which we got
from their documentation. You'll see

1148
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
from their documentation. You'll see
 

1149
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,470
from their documentation. You'll see
we're passing along once again this

1150
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
we're passing along once again this
 

1151
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,549
we're passing along once again this
Google Drive link which if you open this

1152
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
Google Drive link which if you open this
 

1153
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,230
Google Drive link which if you open this
this is just going to point to that same

1154
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
this is just going to point to that same
 

1155
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,950
this is just going to point to that same
image that we gave our agent before but

1156
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
image that we gave our agent before but
 

1157
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,029
image that we gave our agent before but
obviously we also have to give it to our

1158
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
obviously we also have to give it to our
 

1159
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,190
obviously we also have to give it to our
chatpt image model the same way that you

1160
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
chatpt image model the same way that you
 

1161
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,710
chatpt image model the same way that you
would actually do it if you were in

1162
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
would actually do it if you were in
 

1163
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,190
would actually do it if you were in
chatgpt.com. And then we just have the

1164
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
chatgpt.com. And then we just have the
 

1165
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,190
chatgpt.com. And then we just have the
prompt here which is again a dynamic

1166
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
prompt here which is again a dynamic
 

1167
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,270
prompt here which is again a dynamic
value but you can see that we just got

1168
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
value but you can see that we just got
 

1169
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,430
value but you can see that we just got
this from this previous image prompt and

1170
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
this from this previous image prompt and
 

1171
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,750
this from this previous image prompt and
so that is what is showing and you can

1172
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
so that is what is showing and you can
 

1173
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,750
so that is what is showing and you can
actually cycle through this to show the

1174
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
actually cycle through this to show the
 

1175
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,750
actually cycle through this to show the
tree prompts that we're about to pass

1176
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
tree prompts that we're about to pass
 

1177
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,830
tree prompts that we're about to pass
along. Now there's some special

1178
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
along. Now there's some special
 

1179
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,110
along. Now there's some special
characters here right where we are

1180
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
characters here right where we are
 

1181
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,950
characters here right where we are
replacing a few things. This is just a

1182
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
replacing a few things. This is just a
 

1183
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,350
replacing a few things. This is just a
way in N8N to what you call escape

1184
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
way in N8N to what you call escape
 

1185
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,990
way in N8N to what you call escape
characters like these double quotes or

1186
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
characters like these double quotes or
 

1187
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,510
characters like these double quotes or
these back slashn or new lines because

1188
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
these back slashn or new lines because
 

1189
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,750
these back slashn or new lines because
to services like key it will actually

1190
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
to services like key it will actually
 

1191
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,070
to services like key it will actually
cause problems for you. So this sort of

1192
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
cause problems for you. So this sort of
 

1193
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,590
cause problems for you. So this sort of
syntax handles that for you

1194
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
syntax handles that for you
 

1195
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,110
syntax handles that for you
automatically because if you don't have

1196
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
automatically because if you don't have
 

1197
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,350
automatically because if you don't have
that it will say something like the JSON

1198
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
that it will say something like the JSON
 

1199
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,029
that it will say something like the JSON
structure is incorrect. So there's a lot

1200
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
structure is incorrect. So there's a lot
 

1201
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,870
structure is incorrect. So there's a lot
of sensitivity there. This is just a

1202
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
of sensitivity there. This is just a
 

1203
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,110
of sensitivity there. This is just a
required field I believe where we are

1204
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
required field I believe where we are
 

1205
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,430
required field I believe where we are
defining how many images we want and

1206
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
defining how many images we want and
 

1207
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,870
defining how many images we want and
obviously for this case we just want

1208
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
obviously for this case we just want
 

1209
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,190
obviously for this case we just want
one. So the last thing I set up here is

1210
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
one. So the last thing I set up here is
 

1211
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,029
one. So the last thing I set up here is
just a batching component. So what that

1212
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
just a batching component. So what that
 

1213
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,630
just a batching component. So what that
is basically saying is since we have

1214
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
is basically saying is since we have
 

1215
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,390
is basically saying is since we have
three items to pass, we'll just pass

1216
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
three items to pass, we'll just pass
 

1217
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,789
three items to pass, we'll just pass
them one by one, one item per batch in

1218
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
them one by one, one item per batch in
 

1219
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,110
them one by one, one item per batch in
an interval of 3,000 milliseconds. So

1220
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
an interval of 3,000 milliseconds. So
 

1221
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,630
an interval of 3,000 milliseconds. So
basically 3 seconds. And that's just a

1222
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
basically 3 seconds. And that's just a
 

1223
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,669
basically 3 seconds. And that's just a
way to not overload the request, which

1224
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
way to not overload the request, which
 

1225
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,390
way to not overload the request, which
sometimes results to problems with the

1226
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
sometimes results to problems with the
 

1227
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,870
sometimes results to problems with the
payload. So if we execute this step, it

1228
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
payload. So if we execute this step, it
 

1229
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,350
payload. So if we execute this step, it
will show a status of 200, which means

1230
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
will show a status of 200, which means
 

1231
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,390
will show a status of 200, which means
that our request has been accepted. It

1232
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
that our request has been accepted. It
 

1233
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,390
that our request has been accepted. It
doesn't mean that the image has been

1234
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
doesn't mean that the image has been
 

1235
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,310
doesn't mean that the image has been
generated yet because that does take

1236
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
generated yet because that does take
 

1237
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,070
generated yet because that does take
time which is why we have a wait node

1238
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
time which is why we have a wait node
 

1239
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,070
time which is why we have a wait node
here which if we open that we just set

1240
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
here which if we open that we just set
 

1241
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,950
here which if we open that we just set
this as 300 seconds or 5 minutes which

1242
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
this as 300 seconds or 5 minutes which
 

1243
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,710
this as 300 seconds or 5 minutes which
is usually more than enough time for the

1244
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
is usually more than enough time for the
 

1245
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,630
is usually more than enough time for the
images to generate. So if you execute

1246
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
images to generate. So if you execute
 

1247
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,549
images to generate. So if you execute
this step what that will just do is

1248
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
this step what that will just do is
 

1249
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,190
this step what that will just do is
countdown literally from 300 seconds to

1250
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
countdown literally from 300 seconds to
 

1251
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,669
countdown literally from 300 seconds to
zero. So once that is done you can now

1252
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
zero. So once that is done you can now
 

1253
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,909
zero. So once that is done you can now
move on to this next node which is just

1254
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
move on to this next node which is just
 

1255
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,669
move on to this next node which is just
a way for us to get the images that we

1256
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
a way for us to get the images that we
 

1257
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,510
a way for us to get the images that we
just generated. So it's another HTTP

1258
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
just generated. So it's another HTTP
 

1259
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,270
just generated. So it's another HTTP
request node where we are getting the

1260
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
request node where we are getting the
 

1261
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,390
request node where we are getting the
images from this URL of key AI and again

1262
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
images from this URL of key AI and again
 

1263
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,630
images from this URL of key AI and again
this is as per their documentation. We

1264
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
this is as per their documentation. We
 

1265
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,070
this is as per their documentation. We
just have our credential set up there

1266
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
just have our credential set up there
 

1267
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,669
just have our credential set up there
once again and the only thing that we

1268
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
once again and the only thing that we
 

1269
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,549
once again and the only thing that we
are passing here is the task ID which we

1270
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
are passing here is the task ID which we
 

1271
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,789
are passing here is the task ID which we
got coming from the create image that

1272
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
got coming from the create image that
 

1273
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,710
got coming from the create image that
was assigned to us to point to the

1274
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
was assigned to us to point to the
 

1275
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,549
was assigned to us to point to the
specific request that we just made for

1276
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
specific request that we just made for
 

1277
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,710
specific request that we just made for
it because key AI is a big place. This

1278
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
it because key AI is a big place. This
 

1279
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,669
it because key AI is a big place. This
one ID will just point to what image we

1280
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
one ID will just point to what image we
 

1281
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,310
one ID will just point to what image we
actually generated. So if we execute

1282
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
actually generated. So if we execute
 

1283
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,350
actually generated. So if we execute
this step, we can see if that image has

1284
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
this step, we can see if that image has
 

1285
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,110
this step, we can see if that image has
now been done. And even though this is a

1286
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
now been done. And even though this is a
 

1287
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,190
now been done. And even though this is a
status code of 200, sometimes it varies

1288
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
status code of 200, sometimes it varies
 

1289
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,430
status code of 200, sometimes it varies
per provider. For KAI for example, what

1290
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
per provider. For KAI for example, what
 

1291
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,950
per provider. For KAI for example, what
you actually need to look for is this

1292
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
you actually need to look for is this
 

1293
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,590
you actually need to look for is this
success flag. And since it says zero and

1294
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
success flag. And since it says zero and
 

1295
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,350
success flag. And since it says zero and
since there is no image URL anywhere

1296
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
since there is no image URL anywhere
 

1297
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,830
since there is no image URL anywhere
here, that basically means that it is

1298
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
here, that basically means that it is
 

1299
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,830
here, that basically means that it is
still generating. In fact, it says so

1300
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
still generating. In fact, it says so
 

1301
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,750
still generating. In fact, it says so
right here. So if it's still generating

1302
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
right here. So if it's still generating
 

1303
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,149
right here. So if it's still generating
what basically will happen here is after

1304
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
what basically will happen here is after
 

1305
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,789
what basically will happen here is after
this node there is this if node which is

1306
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
this node there is this if node which is
 

1307
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,710
this node there is this if node which is
pretty standard practice with a lot of

1308
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
pretty standard practice with a lot of
 

1309
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,270
pretty standard practice with a lot of
these creative N8N workflows where

1310
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
these creative N8N workflows where
 

1311
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,669
these creative N8N workflows where
basically what this is saying is if that

1312
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
basically what this is saying is if that
 

1313
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,510
basically what this is saying is if that
success flag is equal to one let's

1314
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
success flag is equal to one let's
 

1315
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,430
success flag is equal to one let's
proceed to the next step but since it is

1316
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
proceed to the next step but since it is
 

1317
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,510
proceed to the next step but since it is
not get one what will happen is if we

1318
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
not get one what will happen is if we
 

1319
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,830
not get one what will happen is if we
execute this step it will just map to

1320
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
execute this step it will just map to
 

1321
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,470
execute this step it will just map to
the false branch here right so what

1322
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
the false branch here right so what
 

1323
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,470
the false branch here right so what
happens there visually is that instead

1324
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
happens there visually is that instead
 

1325
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,149
happens there visually is that instead
of mapping to true and proceeding to

1326
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
of mapping to true and proceeding to
 

1327
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,990
of mapping to true and proceeding to
creating the videos we just mapped it

1328
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
creating the videos we just mapped it
 

1329
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,710
creating the videos we just mapped it
back to the wait node for us to wait a

1330
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
back to the wait node for us to wait a
 

1331
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,029
back to the wait node for us to wait a
bit more. And so whenever you run this,

1332
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
bit more. And so whenever you run this,
 

1333
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,029
bit more. And so whenever you run this,
it will just loop back up until all of

1334
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
it will just loop back up until all of
 

1335
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,190
it will just loop back up until all of
those images have been generated. And if

1336
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
those images have been generated. And if
 

1337
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,710
those images have been generated. And if
you are running through this manually,

1338
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
you are running through this manually,
 

1339
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,630
you are running through this manually,
what you can actually do is if you go to

1340
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
what you can actually do is if you go to
 

1341
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,350
what you can actually do is if you go to
your KAI dashboard, you can just head to

1342
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
your KAI dashboard, you can just head to
 

1343
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,470
your KAI dashboard, you can just head to
your logs section here and under 40

1344
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
your logs section here and under 40
 

1345
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,390
your logs section here and under 40
image, you'll be able to find the status

1346
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
image, you'll be able to find the status
 

1347
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,390
image, you'll be able to find the status
of those three requests. And you can see

1348
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
of those three requests. And you can see
 

1349
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,750
of those three requests. And you can see
here that they have now finished

1350
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
here that they have now finished
 

1351
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,070
here that they have now finished
generating. And so if we re-execute this

1352
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
generating. And so if we re-execute this
 

1353
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,909
generating. And so if we re-execute this
get image step, you'll now see that the

1354
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
get image step, you'll now see that the
 

1355
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,070
get image step, you'll now see that the
success flag for these three items are

1356
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
success flag for these three items are
 

1357
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,789
success flag for these three items are
now one. The status also says success.

1358
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
now one. The status also says success.
 

1359
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,470
now one. The status also says success.
So that is looking good. And in fact

1360
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
So that is looking good. And in fact
 

1361
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,149
So that is looking good. And in fact
here obviously when this workflow runs

1362
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
here obviously when this workflow runs
 

1363
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,669
here obviously when this workflow runs
in the background, you won't see these

1364
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
in the background, you won't see these
 

1365
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,830
in the background, you won't see these
URLs anymore. But if you just copy

1366
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
URLs anymore. But if you just copy
 

1367
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,750
URLs anymore. But if you just copy
those, you can actually preview it in

1368
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
those, you can actually preview it in
 

1369
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,750
those, you can actually preview it in
your browser tab. And that is looking

1370
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
your browser tab. And that is looking
 

1371
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,669
your browser tab. And that is looking
pretty good. So it's in landscape, the

1372
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
pretty good. So it's in landscape, the
 

1373
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,070
pretty good. So it's in landscape, the
guy's in a car, which is as per our

1374
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
guy's in a car, which is as per our
 

1375
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,669
guy's in a car, which is as per our
instructions with the agent earlier. And

1376
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
instructions with the agent earlier. And
 

1377
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,230
instructions with the agent earlier. And
it actually looks very realistic. And it

1378
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
it actually looks very realistic. And it
 

1379
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,310
it actually looks very realistic. And it
even got a lot of the text correct.

1380
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
even got a lot of the text correct.
 

1381
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,549
even got a lot of the text correct.
Obviously, it's not as perfect yet, but

1382
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
Obviously, it's not as perfect yet, but
 

1383
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,149
Obviously, it's not as perfect yet, but
honestly, if you just zoom out and later

1384
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
honestly, if you just zoom out and later
 

1385
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,990
honestly, if you just zoom out and later
once you see this as a video, a lot of

1386
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
once you see this as a video, a lot of
 

1387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,149
once you see this as a video, a lot of
those will not really be noticeable. And

1388
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
those will not really be noticeable. And
 

1389
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,590
those will not really be noticeable. And
this is also the worst that it will ever

1390
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
this is also the worst that it will ever
 

1391
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,430
this is also the worst that it will ever
become because text adherence is so

1392
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
become because text adherence is so
 

1393
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,950
become because text adherence is so
important. I feel like at some point

1394
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
important. I feel like at some point
 

1395
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,190
important. I feel like at some point
these problems will anyway be solved.

1396
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
these problems will anyway be solved.
 

1397
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,870
these problems will anyway be solved.
Anyway, that is good. You now have your

1398
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
Anyway, that is good. You now have your
 

1399
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,870
Anyway, that is good. You now have your
three images. This is the second one.

1400
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
three images. This is the second one.
 

1401
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,310
three images. This is the second one.
So, that's looking good as well. And

1402
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
So, that's looking good as well. And
 

1403
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,310
So, that's looking good as well. And
this is the third one. So, this one's

1404
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
this is the third one. So, this one's
 

1405
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,669
this is the third one. So, this one's
interesting because they're not looking

1406
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
interesting because they're not looking
 

1407
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,830
interesting because they're not looking
at the camera. So, we'll see how V3

1408
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
at the camera. So, we'll see how V3
 

1409
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,510
at the camera. So, we'll see how V3
handles that. But, all right. Now that

1410
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
handles that. But, all right. Now that
 

1411
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,830
handles that. But, all right. Now that
that is done, we can proceed. Let me

1412
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
that is done, we can proceed. Let me
 

1413
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,350
that is done, we can proceed. Let me
just pin these nodes so that I don't

1414
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
just pin these nodes so that I don't
 

1415
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,669
just pin these nodes so that I don't
lose them. There you go. Because now we

1416
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
lose them. There you go. Because now we
 

1417
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,350
lose them. There you go. Because now we
are going to create the videos, right?

1418
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
are going to create the videos, right?
 

1419
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,430
are going to create the videos, right?
So this is once again we are going to

1420
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
So this is once again we are going to
 

1421
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,909
So this is once again we are going to
post a request. We are still using KI as

1422
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
post a request. We are still using KI as
 

1423
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,750
post a request. We are still using KI as
a service, but this time we'll be using

1424
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
a service, but this time we'll be using
 

1425
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,390
a service, but this time we'll be using
V3. Now the reason why I chose KAI for

1426
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
V3. Now the reason why I chose KAI for
 

1427
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,789
V3. Now the reason why I chose KAI for
this workflow is because as of right now

1428
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
this workflow is because as of right now
 

1429
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,350
this workflow is because as of right now
they actually offer V3 at the cheapest

1430
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
they actually offer V3 at the cheapest
 

1431
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,590
they actually offer V3 at the cheapest
possible option for you if you're doing

1432
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
possible option for you if you're doing
 

1433
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,590
possible option for you if you're doing
it on an automated manner. So they're

1434
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
it on an automated manner. So they're
 

1435
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,390
it on an automated manner. So they're
able to offer V3 fast at 40. If you go

1436
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
able to offer V3 fast at 40. If you go
 

1437
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,029
able to offer V3 fast at 40. If you go
to other AI model aggregators like file

1438
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
to other AI model aggregators like file
 

1439
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,190
to other AI model aggregators like file
AI or I think even replicate those

1440
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
AI or I think even replicate those
 

1441
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,710
AI or I think even replicate those
services actually charge a cost of $3.2

1442
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
services actually charge a cost of $3.2
 

1443
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,630
services actually charge a cost of $3.2
per video which is eight times versus

1444
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
per video which is eight times versus
 

1445
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,350
per video which is eight times versus
KAI. Google flow is actually cheaper but

1446
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
KAI. Google flow is actually cheaper but
 

1447
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,029
KAI. Google flow is actually cheaper but
two problems there is you need to

1448
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
two problems there is you need to
 

1449
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,029
two problems there is you need to
subscribe to their monthly plans whereas

1450
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
subscribe to their monthly plans whereas
 

1451
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,950
subscribe to their monthly plans whereas
KAI you can do it on a pay as you go

1452
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
KAI you can do it on a pay as you go
 

1453
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,789
KAI you can do it on a pay as you go
basis and number two I don't think they

1454
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
basis and number two I don't think they
 

1455
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,269
basis and number two I don't think they
have an API yet as of this moment. So

1456
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
have an API yet as of this moment. So
 

1457
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,110
have an API yet as of this moment. So
you'll have to go to their platform and

1458
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
you'll have to go to their platform and
 

1459
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,710
you'll have to go to their platform and
software and you'll have to do a lot of

1460
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
software and you'll have to do a lot of
 

1461
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,870
software and you'll have to do a lot of
the prompt engineering yourself and also

1462
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
the prompt engineering yourself and also
 

1463
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,029
the prompt engineering yourself and also
upload the images coming from chatpt

1464
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
upload the images coming from chatpt
 

1465
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,269
upload the images coming from chatpt
whereas here the N8 workflow as your

1466
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
whereas here the N8 workflow as your
 

1467
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,110
whereas here the N8 workflow as your
orchestrator handles a lot of that

1468
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
orchestrator handles a lot of that
 

1469
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,029
orchestrator handles a lot of that
automation for you and actually talks to

1470
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
automation for you and actually talks to
 

1471
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,630
automation for you and actually talks to
a lot of the models that you need. So

1472
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
a lot of the models that you need. So
 

1473
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,029
a lot of the models that you need. So
it's just much faster overall. Any case

1474
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
it's just much faster overall. Any case
 

1475
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,950
it's just much faster overall. Any case
that is the reason why we're using key

1476
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
that is the reason why we're using key
 

1477
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,310
that is the reason why we're using key
and you can see it's pretty much the

1478
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
and you can see it's pretty much the
 

1479
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,029
and you can see it's pretty much the
same here. And if you open this body

1480
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
same here. And if you open this body
 

1481
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,510
same here. And if you open this body
that is again just coming from KAI's

1482
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
that is again just coming from KAI's
 

1483
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,510
that is again just coming from KAI's
documentation where we are giving it the

1484
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
documentation where we are giving it the
 

1485
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,190
documentation where we are giving it the
prompt which you can see here again you

1486
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
prompt which you can see here again you
 

1487
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,870
prompt which you can see here again you
can shuffle through the three different

1488
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
can shuffle through the three different
 

1489
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,950
can shuffle through the three different
prompts that our AI agent generated for

1490
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
prompts that our AI agent generated for
 

1491
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,110
prompts that our AI agent generated for
us. The model and aspect ratio is here.

1492
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
us. The model and aspect ratio is here.
 

1493
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,950
us. The model and aspect ratio is here.
And then we have here the image URL

1494
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
And then we have here the image URL
 

1495
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,950
And then we have here the image URL
which if we open that that's basically

1496
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
which if we open that that's basically
 

1497
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,029
which if we open that that's basically
the generated image that we had from

1498
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
the generated image that we had from
 

1499
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,110
the generated image that we had from
earlier which is what we need in order

1500
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
earlier which is what we need in order
 

1501
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,870
earlier which is what we need in order
to do an image to video task. So I think

1502
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
to do an image to video task. So I think
 

1503
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,070
to do an image to video task. So I think
we have everything we need. We have

1504
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
we have everything we need. We have
 

1505
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,149
we have everything we need. We have
batching turned on as well here just for

1506
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
batching turned on as well here just for
 

1507
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,830
batching turned on as well here just for
hygiene. And now if we execute that

1508
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
hygiene. And now if we execute that
 

1509
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,110
hygiene. And now if we execute that
step, this should give us status code of

1510
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
step, this should give us status code of
 

1511
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,269
step, this should give us status code of
200 as well, which indicates that we

1512
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
200 as well, which indicates that we
 

1513
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,510
200 as well, which indicates that we
have successfully posted that request.

1514
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
have successfully posted that request.
 

1515
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,350
have successfully posted that request.
And once again, we are going to wait for

1516
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
And once again, we are going to wait for
 

1517
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,909
And once again, we are going to wait for
that generation. This one is set to 600

1518
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
that generation. This one is set to 600
 

1519
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,830
that generation. This one is set to 600
seconds because if you're using V3

1520
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
seconds because if you're using V3
 

1521
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,269
seconds because if you're using V3
quality, that's roughly the time it

1522
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
quality, that's roughly the time it
 

1523
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,430
quality, that's roughly the time it
takes. V3 fast is actually much faster.

1524
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
takes. V3 fast is actually much faster.
 

1525
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,590
takes. V3 fast is actually much faster.
I think 2 minutes, 3 minutes is usually

1526
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
I think 2 minutes, 3 minutes is usually
 

1527
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,029
I think 2 minutes, 3 minutes is usually
enough. So you can just change this if

1528
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
enough. So you can just change this if
 

1529
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,630
enough. So you can just change this if
you want. But if we execute this step,

1530
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
you want. But if we execute this step,
 

1531
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,230
you want. But if we execute this step,
it will just countd down from 600

1532
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
it will just countd down from 600
 

1533
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,230
it will just countd down from 600
seconds to one. same as before. And when

1534
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
seconds to one. same as before. And when
 

1535
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,149
seconds to one. same as before. And when
that node has finished and the workflow

1536
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
that node has finished and the workflow
 

1537
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,909
that node has finished and the workflow
gets to this part, all we are really

1538
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:09,919
gets to this part, all we are really
 

1539
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,669
gets to this part, all we are really
doing is to get that video. Same thing,

1540
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
doing is to get that video. Same thing,
 

1541
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,510
doing is to get that video. Same thing,
we're getting the record info. And same

1542
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
we're getting the record info. And same
 

1543
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,430
we're getting the record info. And same
thing, we are getting the task ID here,

1544
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
thing, we are getting the task ID here,
 

1545
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,669
thing, we are getting the task ID here,
which we got when we sent that request

1546
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
which we got when we sent that request
 

1547
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,110
which we got when we sent that request
and KI assigned us that unique ID. So if

1548
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
and KI assigned us that unique ID. So if
 

1549
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,029
and KI assigned us that unique ID. So if
I execute this step, it will show you

1550
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
I execute this step, it will show you
 

1551
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,590
I execute this step, it will show you
the status of each. The first one is

1552
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
the status of each. The first one is
 

1553
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,430
the status of each. The first one is
actually already complete, but the

1554
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
actually already complete, but the
 

1555
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,230
actually already complete, but the
second one not yet. And so we just have

1556
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
second one not yet. And so we just have
 

1557
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,310
second one not yet. And so we just have
this if node here functioning the same

1558
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
this if node here functioning the same
 

1559
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,470
this if node here functioning the same
way where we are just checking if those

1560
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,480
way where we are just checking if those
 

1561
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,549
way where we are just checking if those
have been all successful or not. And

1562
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
have been all successful or not. And
 

1563
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,149
have been all successful or not. And
here you can see that it sort of

1564
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:38,159
here you can see that it sort of
 

1565
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,669
here you can see that it sort of
bifurcated right? So you have a true

1566
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
bifurcated right? So you have a true
 

1567
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,830
bifurcated right? So you have a true
branch here where one item is already a

1568
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
branch here where one item is already a
 

1569
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,990
branch here where one item is already a
success and the false branch here is

1570
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
success and the false branch here is
 

1571
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,470
success and the false branch here is
basically saying that two generations

1572
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
basically saying that two generations
 

1573
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,549
basically saying that two generations
are still not yet done. So for those two

1574
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
are still not yet done. So for those two
 

1575
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,390
are still not yet done. So for those two
items what'll happen is it'll just go

1576
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
items what'll happen is it'll just go
 

1577
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,990
items what'll happen is it'll just go
back to the wait node while you can see

1578
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
back to the wait node while you can see
 

1579
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,470
back to the wait node while you can see
one item here is already proceeding to

1580
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
one item here is already proceeding to
 

1581
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,070
one item here is already proceeding to
the next step. So that's how it will

1582
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
the next step. So that's how it will
 

1583
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,430
the next step. So that's how it will
happen when it runs in the background.

1584
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
happen when it runs in the background.
 

1585
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,269
happen when it runs in the background.
But for our case, let's just wait for

1586
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
But for our case, let's just wait for
 

1587
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,190
But for our case, let's just wait for
the rest of those two videos before we

1588
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
the rest of those two videos before we
 

1589
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,789
the rest of those two videos before we
proceed. So once again, you can just

1590
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799
proceed. So once again, you can just
 

1591
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,950
proceed. So once again, you can just
check your logs at KAI. And it seems

1592
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
check your logs at KAI. And it seems
 

1593
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,110
check your logs at KAI. And it seems
like those three videos are now all

1594
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
like those three videos are now all
 

1595
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,269
like those three videos are now all
good. So what we'll do next is let's

1596
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
good. So what we'll do next is let's
 

1597
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,990
good. So what we'll do next is let's
just re-execute this get video. And that

1598
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
just re-execute this get video. And that
 

1599
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,630
just re-execute this get video. And that
should indeed tell us that these are all

1600
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
should indeed tell us that these are all
 

1601
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,549
should indeed tell us that these are all
successful. And so now if we click on

1602
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
successful. And so now if we click on
 

1603
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,470
successful. And so now if we click on
this if node, all of them should be

1604
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
this if node, all of them should be
 

1605
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,990
this if node, all of them should be
true. So we're passing along those three

1606
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
true. So we're passing along those three
 

1607
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,390
true. So we're passing along those three
items into our final output nodes where

1608
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:22,400
items into our final output nodes where
 

1609
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,789
items into our final output nodes where
basically we just have this extra node

1610
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
basically we just have this extra node
 

1611
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,789
basically we just have this extra node
to get the video files. All this really

1612
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:26,799
to get the video files. All this really
 

1613
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,950
to get the video files. All this really
does is we have this method set to get.

1614
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
does is we have this method set to get.
 

1615
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,269
does is we have this method set to get.
We are passing along the URLs from the

1616
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:31,279
We are passing along the URLs from the
 

1617
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,269
We are passing along the URLs from the
preceding node which is this result

1618
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
preceding node which is this result
 

1619
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,269
preceding node which is this result
which again this is a link that you can

1620
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
which again this is a link that you can
 

1621
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,789
which again this is a link that you can
actually preview in your browser. It

1622
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
actually preview in your browser. It
 

1623
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,630
actually preview in your browser. It
ends inmpp4. So these are the videos

1624
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
ends inmpp4. So these are the videos
 

1625
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,149
ends inmpp4. So these are the videos
themselves. So we'll be viewing them

1626
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
themselves. So we'll be viewing them
 

1627
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,430
themselves. So we'll be viewing them
later together. And that's everything

1628
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,440
later together. And that's everything
 

1629
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,630
later together. And that's everything
you need for this config. We're

1630
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
you need for this config. We're
 

1631
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,149
you need for this config. We're
basically just translating those URLs

1632
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
basically just translating those URLs
 

1633
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,789
basically just translating those URLs
into once we execute this step actual

1634
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
into once we execute this step actual
 

1635
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,310
into once we execute this step actual
data which if you think about videos

1636
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
data which if you think about videos
 

1637
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,669
data which if you think about videos
they're all just data under the hood

1638
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
they're all just data under the hood
 

1639
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,269
they're all just data under the hood
right. So you have the three items here.

1640
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
right. So you have the three items here.
 

1641
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,070
right. So you have the three items here.
You can actually view them within N8N to

1642
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
You can actually view them within N8N to
 

1643
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,750
You can actually view them within N8N to
preview it. So, this is the first one.

1644
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
preview it. So, this is the first one.
 

1645
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,350
preview it. So, this is the first one.

I've tried. Like, you actually get the
 

1659
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,990
I've tried. Like, you actually get the
punch of citrus. It's kind of addictive.

also see some subtitling here, which is
still a problem sometimes with VO3,

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
still a problem sometimes with VO3,
 

1667
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,190
still a problem sometimes with VO3,
unfortunately. So, as per Google,

1668
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
unfortunately. So, as per Google,
 

1669
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,190
unfortunately. So, as per Google,
they're working on that. But there is a

1670
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
they're working on that. But there is a
 

1671
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,029
they're working on that. But there is a
probability that you may get that. So if

1672
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
probability that you may get that. So if
 

1673
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,310
probability that you may get that. So if
I were to use that video, I'll probably

1674
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
I were to use that video, I'll probably
 

1675
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,750
I were to use that video, I'll probably
just crop that out. And then the third

1676
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
just crop that out. And then the third
 

1677
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,549
just crop that out. And then the third
one, let's see.

1678
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
one, let's see.
 

1679
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,909

can decide this on your own, but we're

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
because that's the file type. We turned
 

1719
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,389
because that's the file type. We turned
on the binary file, which is basically

1720
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
on the binary file, which is basically
 

1721
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,630
on the binary file, which is basically
what you call these files that we just

1722
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
what you call these files that we just
 

1723
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,190
what you call these files that we just
loaded inn. And then the input binary

1724
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
loaded inn. And then the input binary
 

1725
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,510
loaded inn. And then the input binary
field is called data because these are

1726
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
field is called data because these are
 

1727
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,830
field is called data because these are
named as data. So that is quite

1728
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
named as data. So that is quite
 

1729
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,830
named as data. So that is quite
straightforward. If you just execute

1730
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
straightforward. If you just execute
 

1731
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,470
straightforward. If you just execute
that step, what it will now do is upload

1732
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
that step, what it will now do is upload
 

1733
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,549
that step, what it will now do is upload
those into our box account. This is my

1734
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:24,559
those into our box account. This is my
 

1735
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,310
those into our box account. This is my
box account. Let's just refresh that.

1736
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
box account. Let's just refresh that.
 

1737
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,230
box account. Let's just refresh that.
And there you go. We now have those free

1738
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,240
And there you go. We now have those free
 

1739
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,110
And there you go. We now have those free
landscape videos with us as well. And

1740
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
landscape videos with us as well. And
 

1741
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,110
landscape videos with us as well. And
there, that is the workflow in full.

1742
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
there, that is the workflow in full.
 

1743
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,350
there, that is the workflow in full.
Now, a few tips and thoughts as well.

1744
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
Now, a few tips and thoughts as well.
 

1745
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,029
Now, a few tips and thoughts as well.
The great thing about this workflow is

1746
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
The great thing about this workflow is
 

1747
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,630
The great thing about this workflow is
that you can actually feed it any image.

1748
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
that you can actually feed it any image.
 

1749
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,230
that you can actually feed it any image.
So, we have people in the community who

1750
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240
So, we have people in the community who
 

1751
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,470
So, we have people in the community who
tried methods like this with furniture,

1752
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
tried methods like this with furniture,
 

1753
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,149
tried methods like this with furniture,
for example, and that works fairly well.

1754
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
for example, and that works fairly well.
 

1755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,430
for example, and that works fairly well.
And if in case you are working with a

1756
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
And if in case you are working with a
 

1757
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,269
And if in case you are working with a
brand who let's say has a defined target

1758
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
brand who let's say has a defined target
 

1759
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,029
brand who let's say has a defined target
market, you can just go to your edit

1760
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
market, you can just go to your edit
 

1761
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,950
market, you can just go to your edit
fields node and just define that under

1762
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
fields node and just define that under
 

1763
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,630
fields node and just define that under
this special requests on what the age

1764
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:52,640
this special requests on what the age
 

1765
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,310
this special requests on what the age
range is. You can define all of that

1766
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
range is. You can define all of that
 

1767
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,230
range is. You can define all of that
here in your creative brief the same way

1768
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,240
here in your creative brief the same way
 

1769
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,070
here in your creative brief the same way
that you would brief a creative designer

1770
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
that you would brief a creative designer
 

1771
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,350
that you would brief a creative designer
for example. And then the other thing

1772
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
for example. And then the other thing
 

1773
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,110
for example. And then the other thing
that we were discussing in the community

1774
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
that we were discussing in the community
 

1775
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,789
that we were discussing in the community
is the way by which you can pitch

1776
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
is the way by which you can pitch
 

1777
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,710
is the way by which you can pitch
clients using this kind of workflow.

1778
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
clients using this kind of workflow.
 

1779
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,990
clients using this kind of workflow.
Because let's say you have a client in

1780
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
Because let's say you have a client in
 

1781
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,510
Because let's say you have a client in
mind in your network, what you can

1782
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520
mind in your network, what you can
 

1783
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,510
mind in your network, what you can
actually do is just run this workflow on

1784
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
actually do is just run this workflow on
 

1785
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,990
actually do is just run this workflow on
their product without any permission and

1786
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
their product without any permission and
 

1787
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,430
their product without any permission and
just show them the output, right?

1788
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
just show them the output, right?
 

1789
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,029
just show them the output, right?
because I think we're at the stage where

1790
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
because I think we're at the stage where
 

1791
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,710
because I think we're at the stage where
a lot of business owners don't really

1792
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
a lot of business owners don't really
 

1793
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,430
a lot of business owners don't really
realize yet a lot of the capabilities

1794
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
realize yet a lot of the capabilities
 

1795
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,190
realize yet a lot of the capabilities
with video that we have shown here in

1796
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
with video that we have shown here in
 

1797
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,710
with video that we have shown here in
this channel. And so there was one

1798
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
this channel. And so there was one
 

1799
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,710
this channel. And so there was one
member in our community who has found

1800
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
member in our community who has found
 

1801
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,789
member in our community who has found
some success in that similar to if you

1802
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
some success in that similar to if you
 

1803
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,190
some success in that similar to if you
remember when website builders like

1804
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
remember when website builders like
 

1805
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,909
remember when website builders like
framer or web flow or those types of

1806
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
framer or web flow or those types of
 

1807
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,789
framer or web flow or those types of
easy web design platforms came about. It

1808
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
easy web design platforms came about. It
 

1809
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,389
easy web design platforms came about. It
basically enable web design creative

1810
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
basically enable web design creative
 

1811
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,870
basically enable web design creative
agencies to pitch clients by creating

1812
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
agencies to pitch clients by creating
 

1813
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,630
agencies to pitch clients by creating
the website from scratch just to show

1814
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
the website from scratch just to show
 

1815
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,389
the website from scratch just to show
them what the capabilities are even

1816
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
them what the capabilities are even
 

1817
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,630
them what the capabilities are even
before being hired. So that's one option

1818
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
before being hired. So that's one option
 

1819
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,549
before being hired. So that's one option
for you to explore which is possible now

1820
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
for you to explore which is possible now
 

1821
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,870
for you to explore which is possible now
because of the sheer low cost to make

1822
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
because of the sheer low cost to make
 

1823
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,269
because of the sheer low cost to make
one video which is only like 43 cents.

1824
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
one video which is only like 43 cents.
 

1825
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,789
one video which is only like 43 cents.
And if you need a breakdown of the cost,

1826
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
And if you need a breakdown of the cost,
 

1827
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,950
And if you need a breakdown of the cost,
I laid it out here very simple. It's

1828
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
I laid it out here very simple. It's
 

1829
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,110
I laid it out here very simple. It's
basically just 43 cents per video which

1830
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
basically just 43 cents per video which
 

1831
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,830
basically just 43 cents per video which
is magnitudes lower versus if you were

1832
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
is magnitudes lower versus if you were
 

1833
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,070
is magnitudes lower versus if you were
to hire an actor to do this for you. So

1834
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
to hire an actor to do this for you. So
 

1835
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,750
to hire an actor to do this for you. So
that would be your variable cost which

1836
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
that would be your variable cost which
 

1837
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,190
that would be your variable cost which
is basically the cost per video.

1838
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
is basically the cost per video.
 

1839
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,549
is basically the cost per video.
Obviously you have a fixed cost but if

1840
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
Obviously you have a fixed cost but if
 

1841
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,470
Obviously you have a fixed cost but if
you are already using N8N then this is

1842
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
you are already using N8N then this is
 

1843
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,470
you are already using N8N then this is
not really incremental for you but that

1844
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,480
not really incremental for you but that
 

1845
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,389
not really incremental for you but that
is just something to be aware of. And

1846
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
is just something to be aware of. And
 

1847
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,549
is just something to be aware of. And
also obviously this is for an 8-second

1848
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
also obviously this is for an 8-second
 

1849
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,149
also obviously this is for an 8-second
video. In a future lesson that I am

1850
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
video. In a future lesson that I am
 

1851
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,909
video. In a future lesson that I am
planning I will show how you can extend

1852
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:17,919
planning I will show how you can extend
 

1853
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,389
planning I will show how you can extend
that for UGC type videos as well. Still

1854
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
that for UGC type videos as well. Still
 

1855
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,549
that for UGC type videos as well. Still
all automated using N8N. So stay tuned

1856
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
all automated using N8N. So stay tuned
 

1857
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,909
all automated using N8N. So stay tuned
for that. And if you need the template

1858
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
for that. And if you need the template
 

1859
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,190
for that. And if you need the template
for this, which is basically like a

1860
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
for this, which is basically like a
 

1861
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,630
for this, which is basically like a
shortcut where you can just import it

1862
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
shortcut where you can just import it
 

1863
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,950
shortcut where you can just import it
here in N8N without having to set it up

1864
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
here in N8N without having to set it up
 

1865
