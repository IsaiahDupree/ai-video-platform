00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,509
for us. Okay. So once we know our
audience right and we know the key

162
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
audience right and we know the key
 

163
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,589
audience right and we know the key
points we know to whom we're going to

164
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
points we know to whom we're going to
 

165
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,910
points we know to whom we're going to
show the ad which is very important the

166
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
show the ad which is very important the
 

167
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,550
show the ad which is very important the
second step will be to create the actual

168
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
second step will be to create the actual
 

169
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,550
second step will be to create the actual
script. So for this purpose once

170
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
script. So for this purpose once
 

171
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,630
script. So for this purpose once
everything is set and we have mentioned

172
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
everything is set and we have mentioned
 

173
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,390
everything is set and we have mentioned
the key points that we would like to

174
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
the key points that we would like to
 

175
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,710
the key points that we would like to
show in our video we are making the

176
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
show in our video we are making the
 

177
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,710
show in our video we are making the
prompt and asking the chat GPT to create

178
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
prompt and asking the chat GPT to create
 

179
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,270
prompt and asking the chat GPT to create
other us the script and I simply was

180
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
other us the script and I simply was
 

181
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,949
other us the script and I simply was
saying that can you drop me a rough

182
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
saying that can you drop me a rough
 

183
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,589
saying that can you drop me a rough

00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
scenarios ads first it will be like a
 

185
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,550

187
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,470
UGC ads in a kind of in the story format

188
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
of course the audiences like the stories
 

189
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,149
of course the audiences like the stories
right and on the background tools we

190
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
right and on the background tools we
 

191
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,830
right and on the background tools we
will use just a nanab banana pro to

192
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
will use just a nanab banana pro to
 

193
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,470
will use just a nanab banana pro to
generate a character and VO3 for the

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
generate a character and VO3 for the
 

195
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,550
generate a character and VO3 for the
actual video generation we also need to

196
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
actual video generation we also need to
 

197
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,550
actual video generation we also need to
tell to judge a bt once the system is

198
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
tell to judge a bt once the system is
 

199
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,589
tell to judge a bt once the system is
going to create us the actual script it

200
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
going to create us the actual script it
 

201
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,190
going to create us the actual script it
good to mention which kind of tools

202
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
good to mention which kind of tools
 

203
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,710
good to mention which kind of tools
we're going to use because like

204
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
we're going to use because like
 

205
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,390
we're going to use because like
different kind of AI tools they have

206
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
different kind of AI tools they have
 

207
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,550
different kind of AI tools they have
particular limitations and chat GBT

208
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
particular limitations and chat GBT
 

209
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,149
particular limitations and chat GBT
already know about that so it's good to

210
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
already know about that so it's good to
 

211
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,149
already know about that so it's good to
mention what we're going to use so after

212
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
mention what we're going to use so after
 

213
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,430
mention what we're going to use so after
that it has generated me a script and it

214
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
that it has generated me a script and it
 

215
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,670
that it has generated me a script and it
was quite long so I was trying to read

216
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
was quite long so I was trying to read
 

217
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,070
was quite long so I was trying to read
it but I didn't see exactly it was not

218
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
it but I didn't see exactly it was not
 

219
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,990
it but I didn't see exactly it was not
showing me like in terms of in the text

220
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
showing me like in terms of in the text
 

221
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,030
showing me like in terms of in the text
format that I was not able to understand

222
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
format that I was not able to understand
 

223
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,830
format that I was not able to understand
clear what it So then I just follow the

224
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
clear what it So then I just follow the
 

225
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,750
clear what it So then I just follow the
suggestion of the chat GPT that it was

226
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
suggestion of the chat GPT that it was
 

227
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,990
suggestion of the chat GPT that it was
requiring to to create me kind of a next

228
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
requiring to to create me kind of a next
 

229
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,830
requiring to to create me kind of a next
steps and the first option was to turn

230
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
steps and the first option was to turn
 

231
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,229
steps and the first option was to turn
this into word for word UGC script and

232
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
this into word for word UGC script and
 

233
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,390
this into word for word UGC script and
write the voice over only versions. So

234
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
write the voice over only versions. So
 

235
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,910
write the voice over only versions. So
in my case it would be easier to

236
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
in my case it would be easier to
 

237
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,589
in my case it would be easier to
understand what it was talking about

238
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
understand what it was talking about
 

239
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,589
understand what it was talking about
right so I said okay please go with the

240
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
right so I said okay please go with the
 

241
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,189
right so I said okay please go with the
first and the second option and then

242
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
first and the second option and then
 

243
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,710
first and the second option and then
right now you can see that we have like

244
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
right now you can see that we have like
 

245
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,310
right now you can see that we have like
clear the scene number one the scene

246
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
clear the scene number one the scene
 

247
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,390
clear the scene number one the scene
number two and we can see the piece of

248
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
number two and we can see the piece of
 

249
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,629
number two and we can see the piece of
content or kind of the speech that our

250
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
content or kind of the speech that our
 

251
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,629
content or kind of the speech that our
character need to say and it's easier to

252
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
character need to say and it's easier to
 

253
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,230
character need to say and it's easier to
read right now. So the first scene it

254
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
read right now. So the first scene it
 

255
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,710
read right now. So the first scene it
was why do blackheads never fully go

256
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
was why do blackheads never fully go
 

257
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,030
was why do blackheads never fully go
away no matter what I do. So in already

258
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
away no matter what I do. So in already
 

259
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,550
away no matter what I do. So in already
in this case we're going to tell about

260
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
in this case we're going to tell about
 

261
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,710
in this case we're going to tell about
the problem. Then I was getting facial

262
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
the problem. Then I was getting facial
 

263
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,469
the problem. Then I was getting facial
using strips trying everything. Then we

264
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
using strips trying everything. Then we
 

265
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,550
using strips trying everything. Then we
showing which kind of efforts the person

266
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
showing which kind of efforts the person
 

267
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,710
showing which kind of efforts the person
has made and then it was saying so I

268
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
has made and then it was saying so I
 

269
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,629
has made and then it was saying so I
tried this at home blackhead tool and I

270
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
tried this at home blackhead tool and I
 

271
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,710
tried this at home blackhead tool and I
found online and I didn't expect much.

272
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
found online and I didn't expect much.
 

273
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,310
found online and I didn't expect much.
So it was just like okay I bought

274
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
So it was just like okay I bought
 

275
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,670
So it was just like okay I bought
something and due to the thing that I

276
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
something and due to the thing that I
 

277
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,189
something and due to the thing that I
tried everything of course I was not

278
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
tried everything of course I was not
 

279
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,189
tried everything of course I was not
expecting but then literally pulls out

280
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
expecting but then literally pulls out
 

281
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,790
expecting but then literally pulls out
the buildup from my pores without

282
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
the buildup from my pores without
 

283
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,030
the buildup from my pores without
hurting. We already like showing the

284
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
hurting. We already like showing the
 

285
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,350
hurting. We already like showing the
effect and my skin feels way clean and

286
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
effect and my skin feels way clean and
 

287
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,870
effect and my skin feels way clean and
blah blah blah. So of course that was

288
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
blah blah blah. So of course that was
 

289
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,950
blah blah blah. So of course that was
the draft scenario and in case if you go

290
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
the draft scenario and in case if you go
 

291
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,590
the draft scenario and in case if you go
to work with the chat GPT sometimes it

292
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
to work with the chat GPT sometimes it
 

293
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,430
to work with the chat GPT sometimes it
can create good scenarios sometimes not

294
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
can create good scenarios sometimes not
 

295
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,950
can create good scenarios sometimes not
probably it's not going to be the final

296
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
probably it's not going to be the final
 

297
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,110
probably it's not going to be the final
version so you have to fine-tune so it

298
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
version so you have to fine-tune so it
 

299
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,510
version so you have to fine-tune so it
was a good scratch as the scenario for

300
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
was a good scratch as the scenario for
 

301
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,749
was a good scratch as the scenario for
the UGC ad that I would like to create

302
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
the UGC ad that I would like to create
 

303
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,830
the UGC ad that I would like to create
but at the same time I was not able to

304
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
but at the same time I was not able to
 

305
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,749
but at the same time I was not able to
imagine everything that's why I started

306
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
imagine everything that's why I started
 

307
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,510
imagine everything that's why I started
to have extra conversation with the chat

308
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
to have extra conversation with the chat
 

309
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,990
to have extra conversation with the chat
GPT and finally we came up with the

310
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
GPT and finally we came up with the
 

311
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,909
GPT and finally we came up with the
short script it has included all the

312
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
short script it has included all the
 

313
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,909
short script it has included all the
aspects of the analysis of the marketing

314
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
aspects of the analysis of the marketing
 

315
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,310
aspects of the analysis of the marketing
analysis that GBT made and it sounded

316
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
analysis that GBT made and it sounded
 

317
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,909
analysis that GBT made and it sounded
like this. So, I want to be honest. A

318
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
like this. So, I want to be honest. A
 

319
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,350
like this. So, I want to be honest. A

353
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,230

skin. But I wanted to add another trick

354
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
skin. But I wanted to add another trick
 

355
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,710
skin. But I wanted to add another trick
to this video. Instead of this brand, I

356
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
to this video. Instead of this brand, I
 

357
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,629
to this video. Instead of this brand, I
wanted to include something from my

361
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,670
hats. And I don't know why. Don't ask me
why. This is the first thing that came

362
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
why. This is the first thing that came
 

363
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,670
why. This is the first thing that came
to my mind with the tricky mind. It was

364
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
to my mind with the tricky mind. It was
 

365
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,990
to my mind with the tricky mind. It was
the Holy Billy. And instead of the April

366
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
the Holy Billy. And instead of the April
 

367
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,749
the Holy Billy. And instead of the April
skin, I wanted to write this brand. And

00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
skin, I wanted to write this brand. And
 

369
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,390

And this is the AI tool that we're going

372
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
And this is the AI tool that we're going
 

373
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,469
And this is the AI tool that we're going
to work with the image generation. And

374
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
to work with the image generation. And
 

375
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,150
to work with the image generation. And
we will spend some time in this tool

376
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
we will spend some time in this tool
 

377
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,230
we will spend some time in this tool
within the other section. But if we talk

378
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
within the other section. But if we talk
 

379
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,150
within the other section. But if we talk
about exactly about this product, that's

380
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
about exactly about this product, that's
 

381
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,990
about exactly about this product, that's
also what you can do. Right? So you can

382
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
also what you can do. Right? So you can
 

383
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,830
also what you can do. Right? So you can
take this product, the one that I just

384
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
take this product, the one that I just
 

385
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,990
take this product, the one that I just
showed you on Amazon. You can take the

386
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
showed you on Amazon. You can take the
 

387
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,790
showed you on Amazon. You can take the
screenshot of this and uh then you can

388
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
screenshot of this and uh then you can
 

389
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,270
screenshot of this and uh then you can
simply rebrand it or to put your own

390
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
simply rebrand it or to put your own
 

391
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,110
simply rebrand it or to put your own
brand. And that was actually quite easy,

392
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
brand. And that was actually quite easy,
 

393
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,790
brand. And that was actually quite easy,
right? So I just said, "Okay, so this is

394
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
right? So I just said, "Okay, so this is
 

395
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,629
right? So I just said, "Okay, so this is
a screenshot. Please replace the brand

396
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
a screenshot. Please replace the brand

00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
and write the Holy Billy." And easy
 

399
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,070
and write the Holy Billy." And easy
peasy, we got this Holy Billy. But

400
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
peasy, we got this Holy Billy. But
 

401
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,309
peasy, we got this Holy Billy. But
another thing, I also didn't want to

402
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
another thing, I also didn't want to
 

403
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,150
another thing, I also didn't want to
keep this hands. And this is kind of

404
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
keep this hands. And this is kind of
 

405
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,909
keep this hands. And this is kind of
another trick that you can do. You can

406
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
another trick that you can do. You can
 

407
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,070
another trick that you can do. You can
ask the nana banana to remove something,

408
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
ask the nana banana to remove something,
 

409
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,909
ask the nana banana to remove something,
remove the elements and it perfectly

410
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
remove the elements and it perfectly
 

411
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,670
remove the elements and it perfectly
made the job. So I said okay remove the

412
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
made the job. So I said okay remove the
 

413
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,430
made the job. So I said okay remove the
hand. So just a can will last. Then

414
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
hand. So just a can will last. Then
 

415
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,189
hand. So just a can will last. Then
another thing as you can see that open

416
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
another thing as you can see that open
 

417
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,029
another thing as you can see that open
like it opened cream and I didn't know

418
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
like it opened cream and I didn't know
 

419
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,870
like it opened cream and I didn't know
in case if I would like to use this

420
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
in case if I would like to use this
 

421
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,430
in case if I would like to use this
product with a cover on that and that's

422
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
product with a cover on that and that's
 

423
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,510
product with a cover on that and that's
why I said that put a cream cap and boom

424
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
why I said that put a cream cap and boom
 

425
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,189
why I said that put a cream cap and boom
we can see the cream cap. So basically

426
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
we can see the cream cap. So basically
 

427
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,950
we can see the cream cap. So basically
everything looks natural right then I

428
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
everything looks natural right then I
 

429
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,189
everything looks natural right then I
said that's quite interesting a prompt

430
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
said that's quite interesting a prompt
 

431
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,710
said that's quite interesting a prompt
actually in case if you are working with

432
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
actually in case if you are working with
 

433
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,390
actually in case if you are working with
the product ads and you would like to

434
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
the product ads and you would like to
 

435
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,070
the product ads and you would like to
see it from different angles you could

436
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
see it from different angles you could
 

437
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,909
see it from different angles you could
say that make a grid of this product

438
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
say that make a grid of this product
 

439
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,589
say that make a grid of this product
from different angles like three on

440
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
from different angles like three on
 

441
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,029
from different angles like three on
three so you can create different kind

442
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
three so you can create different kind
 

443
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,029
three so you can create different kind
of grids and you can set like the

444
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
of grids and you can set like the
 

445
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,710
of grids and you can set like the
specific number of columns and rows

446
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
specific number of columns and rows
 

447
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,230
specific number of columns and rows
together and it can give you like

448
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
together and it can give you like
 

449
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,070
together and it can give you like
different angles and that's kind of the

450
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
different angles and that's kind of the
 

451
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,990
different angles and that's kind of the
example so it's like from the top and

452
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
example so it's like from the top and
 

453
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,070
example so it's like from the top and
from the angle view so without the can

454
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
from the angle view so without the can
 

455
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,990
from the angle view so without the can
with the can but let's go back to the

456
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
with the can but let's go back to the
 

457
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,830
with the can but let's go back to the
this section so this is the way how I

458
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
this section so this is the way how I
 

459
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,270
this section so this is the way how I
showed you you and play around with

460
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
showed you you and play around with
 

461
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,189
showed you you and play around with
different products and to put the custom

462
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
different products and to put the custom

look so much better. So, if you're
dealing with the same black hat problem,

478
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
dealing with the same black hat problem,
 

479
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,830
dealing with the same black hat problem,
this is definitely something worth

480
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
this is definitely something worth
 

481
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,749
this is definitely something worth
trying. So, we have the script and the

482
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
trying. So, we have the script and the
 

483
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,670
trying. So, we have the script and the
next section will be to generate the

484
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
next section will be to generate the
 

485
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,589
next section will be to generate the
first frames in Nana Banana Pro that

486
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
first frames in Nana Banana Pro that
 

487
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,510
first frames in Nana Banana Pro that
we're going to use in Vo 3 to generate

488
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
we're going to use in Vo 3 to generate
 

489
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,909
we're going to use in Vo 3 to generate
our videos. Okay, so once we already

490
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
our videos. Okay, so once we already
 

491
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,670
our videos. Okay, so once we already
have the script and everything is ready,

492
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
have the script and everything is ready,
 

493
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,909
have the script and everything is ready,
right? The next step will be to creating

494
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
right? The next step will be to creating
 

495
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,830
right? The next step will be to creating
our character, right? There are like few

496
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
our character, right? There are like few
 

497
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,510
our character, right? There are like few
methods that you can do. So the first

498
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
methods that you can do. So the first
 

499
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,830
methods that you can do. So the first
thing you need to do is to go to the

500
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
thing you need to do is to go to the

This is the way how you can create your

524
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
This is the way how you can create your
 

525

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
character. But another way is that you
 

527
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,750
character. But another way is that you
can simply go to the internet or to

528
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
can simply go to the internet or to
 

529
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,269
can simply go to the internet or to
check some kind of YouTube video where

530
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
check some kind of YouTube video where
 

531
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,509
check some kind of YouTube video where
the UGC creator is speaking and you

532
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519

533
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,870
the UGC creator is speaking and you

environment that you would like to have.
 

537
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,630
environment that you would like to have.
My case, I just started to check when in

538
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
My case, I just started to check when in
 

539
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,310
My case, I just started to check when in
the internet and I found this lady and

540
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
the internet and I found this lady and
 

541
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,710
the internet and I found this lady and
she's sitting in the car. It was really

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
she's sitting in the car. It was really
 

543
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,790

super great like to have such kind of an
environment that it's not going to be

546
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
environment that it's not going to be
 

547
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,070
environment that it's not going to be
like a professional right filmmaker who

548
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
like a professional right filmmaker who
 

549
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,910
like a professional right filmmaker who
is filming the lady that's sheically

is filming the lady that's sheically
just put up the phone and started to

552
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
just put up the phone and started to
 

553
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,190
just put up the phone and started to
film herself and that's just a normal

554
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
film herself and that's just a normal
 

555
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,070
film herself and that's just a normal
car. So this is about the audiences that

556
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
car. So this is about the audiences that
 

557
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,750
car. So this is about the audiences that
I wanted to sell my product but at the

558
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
I wanted to sell my product but at the
 

559
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,190
I wanted to sell my product but at the
same time I didn't want to use this

560
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
same time I didn't want to use this
 

561
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,030
same time I didn't want to use this
lady. I wanted to have the particular

562
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
lady. I wanted to have the particular
 

563
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,949
lady. I wanted to have the particular
environment and I wanted to change this

564
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
environment and I wanted to change this
 

565
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,230
environment and I wanted to change this
character. So I just attached the

566
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
character. So I just attached the
 

567
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,070
character. So I just attached the
reference image and I said can you make

568
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
reference image and I said can you make
 

569
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,630
reference image and I said can you make
a change that this woman 30 years old

570
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
a change that this woman 30 years old
 

571
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,190
a change that this woman 30 years old
and good-looking and blonde lady. Right.

572
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
and good-looking and blonde lady. Right.
 

573
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,949
and good-looking and blonde lady. Right.
So, it was easy and this is kind of the

574
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
So, it was easy and this is kind of the
 

575
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,110
So, it was easy and this is kind of the
result that I got. That's amazing. As we

576
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
result that I got. That's amazing. As we
 

577
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,710
result that I got. That's amazing. As we
can see, that's the same car. It's a

578
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
can see, that's the same car. It's a
 

579
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,710
can see, that's the same car. It's a
blonde lady. It's totally new, right?

580
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
blonde lady. It's totally new, right?
 

581
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,389
blonde lady. It's totally new, right?
She had like a kind of a blue green

582
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
She had like a kind of a blue green
 

583
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,230
She had like a kind of a blue green
eyes. It's exactly that I was looking

584
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
eyes. It's exactly that I was looking
 

585
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,150
eyes. It's exactly that I was looking
for. And the main thing that she doesn't

586
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
for. And the main thing that she doesn't
 

587
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,829
for. And the main thing that she doesn't
look the same as this lady. Maybe like

588
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
look the same as this lady. Maybe like
 

589
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,670
look the same as this lady. Maybe like
the eyes are quite close to that. So,

590
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
the eyes are quite close to that. So,
 

591
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,670
the eyes are quite close to that. So,
for kind of the main character, that's

592
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
for kind of the main character, that's
 

593
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,829
for kind of the main character, that's
it. You don't need to make a lot of the

594
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
it. You don't need to make a lot of the
 

595
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,070
it. You don't need to make a lot of the
effort once you creating the character.

596
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
effort once you creating the character.
 

597
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,590
effort once you creating the character.
That was more than enough. Once we're

598
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
That was more than enough. Once we're
 

599
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,310
That was more than enough. Once we're
going to create the video in the VO3,

600
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
going to create the video in the VO3,
 

601
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,389
going to create the video in the VO3,
you will see that that was enough for

602
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
you will see that that was enough for
 

603
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,230
you will see that that was enough for
the main character. But as you know,

604
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
the main character. But as you know,
 

605
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,150
the main character. But as you know,
once we creating the video, we have like

606
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
once we creating the video, we have like
 

607
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,949
once we creating the video, we have like
two sections or two main elements. The

608
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
two sections or two main elements. The
 

609
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,509
two sections or two main elements. The
video is consisting from the A-rolls and

610
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
video is consisting from the A-rolls and
 

611
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,070
video is consisting from the A-rolls and
B- rolls. The A-roll is the primary main

612
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,080
B- rolls. The A-roll is the primary main
 

613
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,230
B- rolls. The A-roll is the primary main
subject footage that drives the story.

614
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
subject footage that drives the story.
 

615
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,470
subject footage that drives the story.
While B-roll is a supplemental cutwave

616
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
While B-roll is a supplemental cutwave
 

617
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,389
While B-roll is a supplemental cutwave
footage used to support the narrative,

618
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
footage used to support the narrative,
 

619
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,030
footage used to support the narrative,
add visual interest and cover the edits.

620
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
add visual interest and cover the edits.
 

621
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,870
add visual interest and cover the edits.
So it would mean that once we have the

622
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
So it would mean that once we have the
 

623
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,230
So it would mean that once we have the
main character, right? The main

624
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
main character, right? The main
 

625
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,509
main character, right? The main
character is going to tell something,

626
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
character is going to tell something,
 

627
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,190
character is going to tell something,
but at the same time, it's good for

628
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
but at the same time, it's good for
 

629
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,269
but at the same time, it's good for
making the content more interactive and

630
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
making the content more interactive and
 

631
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,030
making the content more interactive and
interesting for the audience, we can add

632
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
interesting for the audience, we can add
 

633
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,710
interesting for the audience, we can add
some kind of elements that for instance,

634
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
some kind of elements that for instance,
 

635
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,470
some kind of elements that for instance,
she's staying in the bathroom and we

636
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
she's staying in the bathroom and we
 

637

showing the effects how she had the
black hats and then the after effect

640
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
black hats and then the after effect
 

641
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,829
black hats and then the after effect
once she has used the products that we

642
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
once she has used the products that we
 

643
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,150
once she has used the products that we
have advertised how she's going to look.

644
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
have advertised how she's going to look.
 

645
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,389
have advertised how she's going to look.
So the effects before and after. Okay.

646
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
So the effects before and after. Okay.
 

647
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,470
So the effects before and after. Okay.
So for the B-roll purposes, I just took

648
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
So for the B-roll purposes, I just took
 

649
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,630
So for the B-roll purposes, I just took
the lady that was generated in the

650
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
the lady that was generated in the
 

651
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,150
the lady that was generated in the
previous chart and I just opened the new

652
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
previous chart and I just opened the new
 

653
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,910
previous chart and I just opened the new
chart in the Gemini and started to play

654
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
chart in the Gemini and started to play
 

655
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,750
chart in the Gemini and started to play
around with this photo. The first prompt

656
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
around with this photo. The first prompt
 

657
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,350
around with this photo. The first prompt
that I wrote that close-up woman on the

658
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
that I wrote that close-up woman on the
 

659
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,269
that I wrote that close-up woman on the
reference image looking into mirror and

660
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
reference image looking into mirror and
 

661
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,870
reference image looking into mirror and
holding a blackhead cleansing and

662
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
holding a blackhead cleansing and
 

663
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,190
holding a blackhead cleansing and
exfoliating tool and trying to clean her

664
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
exfoliating tool and trying to clean her
 

665
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,110
exfoliating tool and trying to clean her
face. So basically I started to generate

666
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
face. So basically I started to generate
 

667
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,710
face. So basically I started to generate
some kind of different scenarios for the

668
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
some kind of different scenarios for the
 

669
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,030
some kind of different scenarios for the
B- rolls and that's the lady was strange

670
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
B- rolls and that's the lady was strange
 

671
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,630
B- rolls and that's the lady was strange
element. That's why I went further and

672
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
element. That's why I went further and
 

673
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,150
element. That's why I went further and
just detached that please replace the

674
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
just detached that please replace the
 

675
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,910
just detached that please replace the
elements on this one and it started to

676
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
elements on this one and it started to
 

677
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,590
elements on this one and it started to
look better but still like didn't look

678
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
look better but still like didn't look
 

679
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,750
look better but still like didn't look
natural. So then I asked something else

680
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
natural. So then I asked something else
 

681
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,590
natural. So then I asked something else
and it has started to generate me the

682
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
and it has started to generate me the
 

683
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,030
and it has started to generate me the
lady that I didn't want to see but at

684
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
lady that I didn't want to see but at
 

685
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,550
lady that I didn't want to see but at
the same time I just took back the

686
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
the same time I just took back the
 

687
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,389
the same time I just took back the
reference image that I wanted to have

688
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
reference image that I wanted to have
 

689
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,389
reference image that I wanted to have
and I said okay replace this woman on

690
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
and I said okay replace this woman on
 

691
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,230
and I said okay replace this woman on
one which is on the reference image

692
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
one which is on the reference image
 

693
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,670
one which is on the reference image
right and after that we started to have

694
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
right and after that we started to have
 

695
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,190
right and after that we started to have
her but at the same time we can see that

696
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
her but at the same time we can see that
 

697
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,509
her but at the same time we can see that
she's filming her on the phone and that

698
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
she's filming her on the phone and that
 

699
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,190
she's filming her on the phone and that
someone is filming that she's filming on

700
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
someone is filming that she's filming on
 

701
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,550
someone is filming that she's filming on
the phone which we don't want to see

702
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
the phone which we don't want to see
 

703
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,230
the phone which we don't want to see
right because we want to show that she's

704
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
right because we want to show that she's
 

705
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,150
right because we want to show that she's
doing everything herself including the

706
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
doing everything herself including the
 

707
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,910
doing everything herself including the
filming and that's why I said okay make

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
filming and that's why I said okay make
 

709
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,990
filming and that's why I said okay make

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
the frame so like she's filming herself
 

711
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,829
the frame so like she's filming herself
so don't show the phone I mean like the

712
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
so don't show the phone I mean like the
 

713
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,190
so don't show the phone I mean like the
impression that this is the picture

714
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
impression that this is the picture
 

715
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,509
impression that this is the picture
taken by her on the phone and that's

716
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
taken by her on the phone and that's
 

717
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,269
taken by her on the phone and that's
what I got. Right? So basically that

718
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
what I got. Right? So basically that
 

719
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,030
what I got. Right? So basically that
she's doing something. She's trying to

720
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
she's doing something. She's trying to
 

721
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,949
she's doing something. She's trying to
remove her black hats. We can see that

722
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
remove her black hats. We can see that
 

723
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,949
remove her black hats. We can see that
the structure of the face right now is

724
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
the structure of the face right now is
 

725
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,710
the structure of the face right now is
not in the perfect condition. So it's

726
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
not in the perfect condition. So it's
 

727
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,710
not in the perfect condition. So it's
like the effect before use of our

728
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
like the effect before use of our
 

729
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,550
like the effect before use of our
product. And then I said now make so

730
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
product. And then I said now make so
 

731
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,310
product. And then I said now make so
that she's just watching into the mirror

732
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
that she's just watching into the mirror
 

733
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,470
that she's just watching into the mirror
with the arms down. And we could use it

734
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
with the arms down. And we could use it
 

735
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,389
with the arms down. And we could use it
for some other purpose once we

736
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
for some other purpose once we
 

737
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,069
for some other purpose once we
generating the videos. And then I wanted

738
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
generating the videos. And then I wanted
 

739
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,310
generating the videos. And then I wanted
to make her face closer and add some

740
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
to make her face closer and add some
 

741
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,790
to make her face closer and add some
more blackheads on her face. So that's

742
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
more blackheads on her face. So that's
 

743
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,269
more blackheads on her face. So that's
perfectly made photo to show that she

744
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
perfectly made photo to show that she
 

745
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,269
perfectly made photo to show that she
had some kind of like a skin problem and

746
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
had some kind of like a skin problem and
 

747
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,870
had some kind of like a skin problem and
this is our character. And then another

748
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
this is our character. And then another
 

749
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,430
this is our character. And then another
thing I wanted to show the after effect

750
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
thing I wanted to show the after effect
 

751
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,110
thing I wanted to show the after effect
once she has used the product that we're

752
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
once she has used the product that we're
 

753
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,870
once she has used the product that we're
trying to sell. And I said now make this

754
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
trying to sell. And I said now make this
 

755
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,030
trying to sell. And I said now make this
lady to look back with clear skin face

756
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
lady to look back with clear skin face
 

757
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,190
lady to look back with clear skin face
as on the reference photo but still in

758
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
as on the reference photo but still in
 

759
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,790
as on the reference photo but still in
the same bathroom and in the same

760
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
the same bathroom and in the same
 

761
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,550
the same bathroom and in the same
t-shirt. And that's what we got. So it's

762
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
t-shirt. And that's what we got. So it's
 

763
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,990
t-shirt. And that's what we got. So it's
kind of the same lady but with a

764
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
kind of the same lady but with a
 

765
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,150
kind of the same lady but with a
different skin texture. Right. And we

766
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
different skin texture. Right. And we
 

767
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,069
different skin texture. Right. And we
can see that that's basically her and

768
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
can see that that's basically her and
 

769
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,150
can see that that's basically her and
the Gemini made perfect work. All right.

770
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
the Gemini made perfect work. All right.
 

771
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,990
the Gemini made perfect work. All right.
Once we have created all the images in

772
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
Once we have created all the images in
 

773
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,990
Once we have created all the images in
the Nanab Banana Pro before we jump in

774
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
the Nanab Banana Pro before we jump in
 

775
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,230
the Nanab Banana Pro before we jump in
into V3, the only thing step is to

776
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
into V3, the only thing step is to
 

777
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,350
into V3, the only thing step is to
upscale and to remove the Gemini created

778
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
upscale and to remove the Gemini created
 

779
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,190
upscale and to remove the Gemini created
symbols in here. And of course, there

780
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
symbols in here. And of course, there
 

781
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,190
symbols in here. And of course, there
are particular tools on the web that you

782
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
are particular tools on the web that you
 

783
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,870
are particular tools on the web that you
can find. But the one that I found

784
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
can find. But the one that I found
 

785
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,389
can find. But the one that I found
actually it's again like the Google

786
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
actually it's again like the Google
 

787
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,150
actually it's again like the Google
product and it's again the Nana Banana

788
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
product and it's again the Nana Banana
 

789
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,910
product and it's again the Nana Banana
Pro, but it's not in the Ji that's

790
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
Pro, but it's not in the Ji that's
 

791
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,069
Pro, but it's not in the Ji that's
already in the Google AI studio. So you

792
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
already in the Google AI studio. So you
 

793
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,590
already in the Google AI studio. So you
need to go there in case if you have the

794
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
need to go there in case if you have the
 

795
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,509
need to go there in case if you have the
account then basically you can simply

796
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
account then basically you can simply
 

797
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,430
account then basically you can simply
start to use the Google AI studio. And

798
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
start to use the Google AI studio. And
 

799
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,509
start to use the Google AI studio. And
within the Google AI studio, in case if

800
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
within the Google AI studio, in case if
 

801
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,990
within the Google AI studio, in case if
we go back to the homepage here, this is

802
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
we go back to the homepage here, this is
 

803
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,910
we go back to the homepage here, this is
kind of the uh starting page where you

804
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
kind of the uh starting page where you
 

805
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,750
kind of the uh starting page where you
going to start there will be a section

806
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
going to start there will be a section
 

807
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,829
going to start there will be a section
explore Nana Banana Pro. Within this

808
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
explore Nana Banana Pro. Within this
 

809
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,910
explore Nana Banana Pro. Within this
section, you will see like where you can

810
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
section, you will see like where you can
 

811
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,670
section, you will see like where you can
start to type in a prompt the same way

812
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
start to type in a prompt the same way
 

813
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,509
start to type in a prompt the same way
as you do in the Gemini. But there will

814
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
as you do in the Gemini. But there will
 

815
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,590
as you do in the Gemini. But there will
be a problem that you need to link the

816
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
be a problem that you need to link the
 

817
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,910
be a problem that you need to link the
paid API key. So once you go into use

818
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
paid API key. So once you go into use
 

819
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,550
paid API key. So once you go into use
this chat, you will be charged for the

820
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
this chat, you will be charged for the
 

821
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,550
this chat, you will be charged for the
image generations, but in the same time

822
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
image generations, but in the same time
 

823
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,790
image generations, but in the same time
that's not going to be super expensive.

824
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
that's not going to be super expensive.
 

825
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,389
that's not going to be super expensive.
So as you can see I've been using

826
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
So as you can see I've been using
 

827
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,230
So as you can see I've been using
multiple inputs and then I got the

828
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
multiple inputs and then I got the
 

829
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,230
multiple inputs and then I got the
multiple outputs and it was not even

830
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
multiple outputs and it was not even
 

831
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,069
multiple outputs and it was not even
sense. So it was even though less and

832
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
sense. So it was even though less and
 

833
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,069
sense. So it was even though less and
actually I have another video how to set

834
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
actually I have another video how to set
 

835
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,030
actually I have another video how to set
up the Google AI studio. So and the link

836
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
up the Google AI studio. So and the link
 

837
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,790
up the Google AI studio. So and the link
will appear just actually now. Okay in

838
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
will appear just actually now. Okay in
 

839
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,790
will appear just actually now. Okay in
case if we go back so in order to

840
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
case if we go back so in order to
 

841
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,550
case if we go back so in order to
upscale the image we're just copy

842
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
upscale the image we're just copy
 

843
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,710
upscale the image we're just copy
pasting the images from the Gemini chart

844
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
pasting the images from the Gemini chart
 

845
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,710
pasting the images from the Gemini chart
and here on the right side we can see

846
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
and here on the right side we can see
 

847
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,790
and here on the right side we can see
that you can set up the aspect ratio.

848
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
that you can set up the aspect ratio.
 

849
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,310
that you can set up the aspect ratio.
And in this case due to the thing that

850
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
And in this case due to the thing that
 

851
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,910
And in this case due to the thing that
we are making it for Tik Tok or

852
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
we are making it for Tik Tok or
 

853
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,750
we are making it for Tik Tok or
Instagram right so we are taking the

854
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
Instagram right so we are taking the
 

855
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,790
Instagram right so we are taking the
aspect ratio 9 to6 which is a mobile

856
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
aspect ratio 9 to6 which is a mobile
 

857
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,710
aspect ratio 9 to6 which is a mobile
phone aspect ratio and at the same time

858
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
phone aspect ratio and at the same time
 

859
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,790
phone aspect ratio and at the same time
we can choose the resolution this case

860
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
we can choose the resolution this case
 

861
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,829
we can choose the resolution this case
we can use 1K 2K 4K if the image is

862
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
we can use 1K 2K 4K if the image is
 

863
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,590
we can use 1K 2K 4K if the image is
bigger of course you're going to pay

864
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
bigger of course you're going to pay
 

865
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,269
bigger of course you're going to pay
higher the price but in our case due to

866
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
higher the price but in our case due to
 

867
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,790
higher the price but in our case due to
the thing that afterwards is going to be

868
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
the thing that afterwards is going to be
 

869
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,470
the thing that afterwards is going to be
for the mobile phone actually the

870
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
for the mobile phone actually the
 

871
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,470
for the mobile phone actually the
resolution for 1K is going to be more

872
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
resolution for 1K is going to be more
 

873
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,230
resolution for 1K is going to be more
than enough so we just taking the photo

874
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
than enough so we just taking the photo
 

875
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,470
than enough so we just taking the photo
and we just saying okay just upscale 9

876
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
and we just saying okay just upscale 9
 

877
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,629
and we just saying okay just upscale 9
to six so simple easygoing prompt And

878
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
to six so simple easygoing prompt And
 

879
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,310
to six so simple easygoing prompt And
afterwards that's the image. So it's

880
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
afterwards that's the image. So it's
 

881
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,069
afterwards that's the image. So it's
upscaled and you can see that this is

882
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
upscaled and you can see that this is
 

883
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,829
upscaled and you can see that this is
our woman. We don't see the symbol in

884
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
our woman. We don't see the symbol in
 

885
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,670
our woman. We don't see the symbol in
here. And actually I did with every

886
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
here. And actually I did with every
 

887
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,310
here. And actually I did with every
photo that I wanted to use in the V3.

888
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
photo that I wanted to use in the V3.
 

889
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,230
photo that I wanted to use in the V3.
Once we all set we are ready to generate

890
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
Once we all set we are ready to generate
 

891
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,910
Once we all set we are ready to generate
the videos. And for this purpose we're

892
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
the videos. And for this purpose we're
 

893
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,910
the videos. And for this purpose we're
going to use the video generator which

894
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
going to use the video generator which
 

895
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,790
going to use the video generator which
is V3. And in order to use the V3 we can

896
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
is V3. And in order to use the V3 we can
 

897
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,030
is V3. And in order to use the V3 we can
go to Flow and this is another Google

898
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
go to Flow and this is another Google
 

899
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,790
go to Flow and this is another Google
product that actually was created for

900
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
product that actually was created for
 

901
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,949
product that actually was created for
the V3 generations. In order to go to

902
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959

flow just write flow. And the first page
here you can see that that's going to be

906
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
here you can see that that's going to be
 

907
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,670
here you can see that that's going to be
a Google labs flow about. Once you land

908
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
a Google labs flow about. Once you land
 

909
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,910
a Google labs flow about. Once you land
here then you just need to uh hit create

910
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
here then you just need to uh hit create
 

911
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,069
here then you just need to uh hit create
with the flow. So once you are within

912
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
with the flow. So once you are within
 

913
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,910
with the flow. So once you are within
the flow you can see the section like to

914
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
the flow you can see the section like to
 

915
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,069
the flow you can see the section like to
generate a video with the text and you

916
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
generate a video with the text and you
 

917
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,910

ingredients to video once we would like
 

933
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,670
ingredients to video once we would like
to integrate our actual product to

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
to integrate our actual product to
 

935
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,829
to integrate our actual product to
advertise. As you remember, we had the

scripts where we had like the speech.
 

939
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,990
scripts where we had like the speech.
Once we going to create the video with

940
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
Once we going to create the video with
 

941
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,949
Once we going to create the video with
the V3, we need to remember that V3 will

942
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
the V3, we need to remember that V3 will
 

943
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,350
the V3, we need to remember that V3 will
generate the clip for 8 seconds. Once

944
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
generate the clip for 8 seconds. Once
 

945
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,509
generate the clip for 8 seconds. Once

another feature that's going to be very
 

1101
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,990
another feature that's going to be very
interesting in this case. I've been

1102
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
interesting in this case. I've been
 

1103
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,150
interesting in this case. I've been
using the ingredients to videos. So I

1104
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
using the ingredients to videos. So I
 

1105
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,310
using the ingredients to videos. So I
used the frame where the lady was

1106
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
used the frame where the lady was
 

1107
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,230
used the frame where the lady was
speaking and then I just make kind of

1108
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
speaking and then I just make kind of
 

1109
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,150
speaking and then I just make kind of
the screenshot of that and at the same

1110
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
the screenshot of that and at the same
 

1111
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,909
the screenshot of that and at the same
time I have attached this product that

1112
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
time I have attached this product that
 

1113
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,909
time I have attached this product that
was rampula and I use this feature. So

1114
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
was rampula and I use this feature. So
 

1115
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,430
was rampula and I use this feature. So
in order to use that you just hit the

1116
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
in order to use that you just hit the
 

1117
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,190
in order to use that you just hit the
ingredients to video then you hit the

1118
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
ingredients to video then you hit the
 

1119
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,590
ingredients to video then you hit the
plus sign and then you choose the actual

1120
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
plus sign and then you choose the actual
 

1121
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,710
plus sign and then you choose the actual
product that you would like to

1122
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
product that you would like to
 

1123
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,470
product that you would like to
advertise. Finally you can add like

1124
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
advertise. Finally you can add like
 

1125
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,909
advertise. Finally you can add like
three ingredients. So for instance you

1126
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
three ingredients. So for instance you
 

1127
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,350
three ingredients. So for instance you
have the lady then the product number

1128
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
have the lady then the product number
 

1129
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,950
have the lady then the product number
one and the product number two. And then

1130
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
one and the product number two. And then
 

1131
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,710
one and the product number two. And then
you just hit the bottom and let's see

1132
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
you just hit the bottom and let's see
 

1133
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,789
you just hit the bottom and let's see
which kind of video I got. Then a friend

1134
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
which kind of video I got. Then a friend
 

1135
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,590
which kind of video I got. Then a friend
of mine suggested this cleansing

1136
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
of mine suggested this cleansing
 

1137
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,390
of mine suggested this cleansing
blackhead applicator called Rampula.

1138
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
blackhead applicator called Rampula.
 

1139
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,549
blackhead applicator called Rampula.
>> So it's perfectly made. You see this is

1140
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
>> So it's perfectly made. You see this is
 

1141
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,630
>> So it's perfectly made. You see this is
the actual product that I had and this

1142
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
the actual product that I had and this
 

1143
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,310
the actual product that I had and this
is the actual ingredient and she showed

1144
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
is the actual ingredient and she showed
 

1145
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,870
is the actual ingredient and she showed
it again. All these nails and fingers

1146
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
it again. All these nails and fingers
 

1147
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,029
it again. All these nails and fingers
everything it is super natural. So this

1148
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
everything it is super natural. So this
 

1149
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,190
everything it is super natural. So this
is the part that we going to use once

1150
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
is the part that we going to use once
 

1151
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,110
is the part that we going to use once
the woman is just talking. It's much

1152
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
the woman is just talking. It's much
 

1153
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,630
the woman is just talking. It's much
better like to show it once she's

1154
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
better like to show it once she's
 

1155
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,070
better like to show it once she's
showing the product and actually it

1156
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
showing the product and actually it
 

1157
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,669
showing the product and actually it
looks real. Yes, there is a difference

1158
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
looks real. Yes, there is a difference
 

1159
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,590
looks real. Yes, there is a difference
with the voice but this section we also

1160
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
with the voice but this section we also
 

1161
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,350
with the voice but this section we also
going to cover in the next section while

1162
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
going to cover in the next section while
 

1163
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,270
going to cover in the next section while
we will make the video editing. So then

1164
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
we will make the video editing. So then
 

1165
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,510
we will make the video editing. So then
I also made the same thing with the

1166
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
I also made the same thing with the
 

1167
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,990
I also made the same thing with the
other product. It was this holy bill

1168
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
other product. It was this holy bill
 

1169
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,909
other product. It was this holy bill
cream and it was also naturally shown

1170
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
cream and it was also naturally shown
 

1171
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,150
cream and it was also naturally shown
and by mistake I also used this prompt

1172
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
and by mistake I also used this prompt
 

1173
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,710
and by mistake I also used this prompt
that it was changing the aspect ratio to

1174
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
that it was changing the aspect ratio to
 

1175
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,789
that it was changing the aspect ratio to
16 to9 and be careful that once you're

1176
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
16 to9 and be careful that once you're
 

1177
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,630
16 to9 and be careful that once you're
generating the video just be specific

1178
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
generating the video just be specific
 

1179
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,310
generating the video just be specific
about the aspect ratio that you would

1180
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
about the aspect ratio that you would
 

1181
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,070
about the aspect ratio that you would
like to have because it has like the 16

1182
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
like to have because it has like the 16
 

1183
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,870
like to have because it has like the 16
to9 and the 9 to6. So I generated this

1184
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
to9 and the 9 to6. So I generated this
 

1185
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,590
to9 and the 9 to6. So I generated this
one. Then I also generated the after

1186
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
one. Then I also generated the after
 

1187
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,310
one. Then I also generated the after
effect and it was several shots once

1188
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
effect and it was several shots once
 

1189
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,029
effect and it was several shots once
lady was using all these products at

1190
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
lady was using all these products at
 

1191
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,350
lady was using all these products at
home and once she was using the ramula.

1192
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
home and once she was using the ramula.
 

1193
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,029
home and once she was using the ramula.
So basically I have generated all the

1194
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
So basically I have generated all the
 

1195
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,870
So basically I have generated all the
frames related to the A-roll and the

1196
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
frames related to the A-roll and the
 

1197
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,029
frames related to the A-roll and the
B-roll. And right now let's go to the

1198
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
B-roll. And right now let's go to the
 

1199
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,270
B-roll. And right now let's go to the
next section actual video editing. Right

1200
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
next section actual video editing. Right
 

1201
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,190
next section actual video editing. Right
now I'm in the video editing tool. I'm

1202
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
now I'm in the video editing tool. I'm
 

1203
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,950
now I'm in the video editing tool. I'm
in the final cut but you can use the

1204
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
in the final cut but you can use the
 

1205
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,710
in the final cut but you can use the
capcat. It really doesn't matter. And

1206
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
capcat. It really doesn't matter. And
 

1207
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,310
capcat. It really doesn't matter. And
the first part that I did, I just

1208
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
the first part that I did, I just
 

1209
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,230
the first part that I did, I just
combined all these video elements that

1210
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
combined all these video elements that
 

1211
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,310
combined all these video elements that
we have generated in the VO3 and I added

1212
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
we have generated in the VO3 and I added
 

1213
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,870
we have generated in the VO3 and I added
all this a-roll right when the lady is

1214
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
all this a-roll right when the lady is
 

1215
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,870
all this a-roll right when the lady is
still sitting in the car and speaking.

1216
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
still sitting in the car and speaking.
 

1217
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,470
still sitting in the car and speaking.
And at the same time, we can see B-

1218
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
And at the same time, we can see B-
 

1219
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,390
And at the same time, we can see B-
rolls integrated where the woman is

1220
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
rolls integrated where the woman is
 

1221
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,470

1222
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480

1223
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,950

standing in the actual bathroom. And at

1224
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
standing in the actual bathroom. And at
 

1225
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,870

the same time, like the moments she was

1226
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
the same time, like the moments she was
 

1227
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,270
the same time, like the moments she was
using the products also in the bathroom,

1228
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
using the products also in the bathroom,
 

1229
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,190
using the products also in the bathroom,
she had a mask then she was using the

1230
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200

1231
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,350
she had a mask then she was using the
another product facial brush in order to

1232
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
another product facial brush in order to
 

1233
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,270
another product facial brush in order to
massage her face. And then she was

1237
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,110

amazing. And finally, she was showing

1238
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
amazing. And finally, she was showing
 

1239
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,590

1240
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
also in the bathroom that her skin feels
 

1241
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,150
also in the bathroom that her skin feels
great and etc. And once V3 is generating

1242
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
great and etc. And once V3 is generating
 

1243
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,990
great and etc. And once V3 is generating
different clip, of course, the voice is

1244
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
different clip, of course, the voice is
 

1245
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,510
different clip, of course, the voice is
changing. And we need to fix this

1246
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
changing. And we need to fix this
 

1247
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,430
changing. And we need to fix this
problem. So in case if I'm going to tone

1248
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
problem. So in case if I'm going to tone
 

1249
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,430
problem. So in case if I'm going to tone
on the video with the original sound, it

1250
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
on the video with the original sound, it
 

1251
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,549
on the video with the original sound, it
will sound like this.

1252
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
will sound like this.
 

1253
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,149
will sound like this.

1337
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,830
>> In my point of view, it sounded very
similar to the voice that was generated

1338
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
similar to the voice that was generated
 

1339
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,110
similar to the voice that was generated
in the B3. So it heard as the UGC

1340
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
in the B3. So it heard as the UGC
 

1341
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,950
in the B3. So it heard as the UGC
character that we had. So then you just

1342
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
character that we had. So then you just
 

1343
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,190
character that we had. So then you just
need to choose the file, you hit open

1344
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
need to choose the file, you hit open
 

1345
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,510
need to choose the file, you hit open
and then you make the settings for this

1346
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
and then you make the settings for this
 

1347
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,110
and then you make the settings for this
one and then you generate the speech.

1348
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
one and then you generate the speech.
 

1349
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,590
one and then you generate the speech.
Then once 11 Labs has created voice then

1350
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
Then once 11 Labs has created voice then
 

1351
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,350
Then once 11 Labs has created voice then
I just upload it back to my video

1352
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
I just upload it back to my video
 

1353
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,190
I just upload it back to my video
editing tool. Then it has started to

1354
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
editing tool. Then it has started to
 

1355
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,830
editing tool. Then it has started to
sound like this.

1356
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
sound like this.
 

1357
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,510

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
we also can hear that during the
 

1367
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,190
we also can hear that during the
transition section in between we don't

1368

transition section in between we don't
 

1369
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,789
transition section in between we don't
see the difference in the voice. But

1370
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
see the difference in the voice. But
 

1371
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,630
see the difference in the voice. But
then another thing that I have faced

then another thing that I have faced
 

1373
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,789
then another thing that I have faced
with it was the actual mistakes in the

1376
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
voice. So in case if we go to hear it
 

1377
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,909
voice. So in case if we go to hear it
again

1378
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
again

around my nose area. So you could hear

1382
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
around my nose area. So you could hear
 

1383
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,510
around my nose area. So you could hear
that she's not saying no. She was saying

1384
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
that she's not saying no. She was saying
 

1385
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,070
that she's not saying no. She was saying
like no. Then what I did I just created

1386
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
like no. Then what I did I just created
 

1387

the captions and then I I just started

1388
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,400
the captions and then I I just started
 

1389
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,310
the captions and then I I just started
to notice all these mistakes where she

1390
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
to notice all these mistakes where she
 

1391
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,110
to notice all these mistakes where she
was saying instead of especially the BO3

1392
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
was saying instead of especially the BO3
 

1393
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,950
was saying instead of especially the BO3
noticed and also the auto caption

1394
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
noticed and also the auto caption
 

1395
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,190
noticed and also the auto caption
generated noticed as socially which is

1396
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
generated noticed as socially which is
 

1397
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,029
generated noticed as socially which is
wrong. Then instead of the nose we can

1398
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
wrong. Then instead of the nose we can
 

1399
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,350
wrong. Then instead of the nose we can
see no sometimes it might occur you

1400
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
see no sometimes it might occur you
 

1401
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,190
see no sometimes it might occur you
can't do anything with that in terms of

1402
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
can't do anything with that in terms of
 

1403
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,190
can't do anything with that in terms of
the occurrence with that but you can fix

1404
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
the occurrence with that but you can fix
 

1405
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,270
the occurrence with that but you can fix
that. In order to fix this you can use

1406
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
that. In order to fix this you can use
 

1407
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,350
that. In order to fix this you can use
again the 11 laps tool. So the first

1408
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
again the 11 laps tool. So the first
 

1409
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,029
again the 11 laps tool. So the first
thing that you need to do, you need to

1410
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
thing that you need to do, you need to
 

1411
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,750
thing that you need to do, you need to

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
pronounced incorrectly. And once you are
 

1427
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,950

here, so you basically paste all this

1428
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
here, so you basically paste all this
 

1429
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,549

incorrectly text that has been
 

1431
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,870
incorrectly text that has been
pronounced by your UGC character. Then

1432
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
pronounced by your UGC character. Then
 

1433
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,789
pronounced by your UGC character. Then
you specify the same voice and then you

1434
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
you specify the same voice and then you
 

1435
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,310
you specify the same voice and then you
hit to generate again. and it's not

1436
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
hit to generate again. and it's not
 

1437
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,149
hit to generate again. and it's not
going to cost you a lot of credits. So,

1438
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
going to cost you a lot of credits. So,
 

1439
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,710
going to cost you a lot of credits. So,
in my case, it was just 255 credits.

1440
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
in my case, it was just 255 credits.
 

1441
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,549
in my case, it was just 255 credits.
