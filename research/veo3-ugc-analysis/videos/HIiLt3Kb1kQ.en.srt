00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,389

In this video, I want to show you how to

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:02,399
In this video, I want to show you how to
 

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,789
In this video, I want to show you how to
do programmatic creative testing at

4
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
do programmatic creative testing at
 

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,990
do programmatic creative testing at
scale. But first, let's figure out what

6
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000
scale. But first, let's figure out what
 

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,950
scale. But first, let's figure out what
it is exactly. See, an ad, it's not only

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
it is exactly. See, an ad, it's not only
 

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,710
it is exactly. See, an ad, it's not only
um a piece of written copy or a nice

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
um a piece of written copy or a nice
 

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,310
um a piece of written copy or a nice
picture. It's you can segment an ad into

12
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
picture. It's you can segment an ad into
 

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,509
picture. It's you can segment an ad into
different predefined parameters. You can

14
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
different predefined parameters. You can
 

15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,670
different predefined parameters. You can
have a unique selling proposition you

16
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
have a unique selling proposition you
 

17
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,790
have a unique selling proposition you
want this specific ad to push. You can

18
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
want this specific ad to push. You can
 

19
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,589
want this specific ad to push. You can
have the marketing angle related to this

20
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
have the marketing angle related to this
 

21
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,069
have the marketing angle related to this
specific unique selling proposition that

22
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
specific unique selling proposition that
 

23
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,470
specific unique selling proposition that
you want the ad to push. You can have a

24
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
you want the ad to push. You can have a
 

25
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,790
you want the ad to push. You can have a
specific messaging framework you want to

26
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
specific messaging framework you want to
 

27
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,750
specific messaging framework you want to
use in your ad. You can use the

28
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
use in your ad. You can use the
 

29
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,869
use in your ad. You can use the
awareness of your prospect related to

30
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
awareness of your prospect related to
 

31
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,510
awareness of your prospect related to
your product or the sophistication of

32
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
your product or the sophistication of
 

33
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,190
your product or the sophistication of
your market or even the length of the

34
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
your market or even the length of the
 

35
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,590
your market or even the length of the
copy. So, as you can see, there are so

36
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
copy. So, as you can see, there are so
 

37
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,510
copy. So, as you can see, there are so
many different variables that we can use

38
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
many different variables that we can use
 

39
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,189
many different variables that we can use
to create an ad. And by an ad, I mean a

40
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
to create an ad. And by an ad, I mean a
 

41
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,869
to create an ad. And by an ad, I mean a
hook or a longer copy that you can use

42
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
hook or a longer copy that you can use
 

43
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,630
hook or a longer copy that you can use
as a mini VSSL or whatever the ad is.

44
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
as a mini VSSL or whatever the ad is.
 

45
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,590
as a mini VSSL or whatever the ad is.
You always can segment it into different

46
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
You always can segment it into different
 

47
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,350
You always can segment it into different
variables. So now that AI can handle the

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
variables. So now that AI can handle the
 

49
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,469
variables. So now that AI can handle the
creative part, if we are able to build a

50
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
creative part, if we are able to build a
 

51
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,590
creative part, if we are able to build a
system to feed the right variables to an

52
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
system to feed the right variables to an
 

53
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,350
system to feed the right variables to an
LLM model, an AI, then the AI can

54
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
LLM model, an AI, then the AI can
 

55
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,469
LLM model, an AI, then the AI can
actually output the ads that we want.

56
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
actually output the ads that we want.
 

57
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,630
actually output the ads that we want.
Exactly. Which allow us to then generate

58
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
Exactly. Which allow us to then generate
 

59
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,990
Exactly. Which allow us to then generate
hundreds or thousands of different ads,

60
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
hundreds or thousands of different ads,
 

61
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,910
hundreds or thousands of different ads,
review them to make sure that they are

62
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
review them to make sure that they are
 

63
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,069
review them to make sure that they are
good. So that's the human touch. and

64
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
good. So that's the human touch. and
 

65
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,390
good. So that's the human touch. and
then push them right away into an ad

66
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,400
then push them right away into an ad
 

67
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,910
then push them right away into an ad
account. So we are able to literally

68
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
account. So we are able to literally
 

69
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,990
account. So we are able to literally
test with a proper structure and test

70
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
test with a proper structure and test
 

71
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,710
test with a proper structure and test
every potential marketing angle and

72
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
every potential marketing angle and
 

73
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,590
every potential marketing angle and
every potential combination that we

74
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
every potential combination that we
 

75
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,389
every potential combination that we
want. And in this video I'm going to

76
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
want. And in this video I'm going to
 

77
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,190
want. And in this video I'm going to
show you you can see two screens. Why is

78
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
show you you can see two screens. Why is
 

79
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,590
show you you can see two screens. Why is
because here it's the thinking process

80
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
because here it's the thinking process
 

81
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,630
because here it's the thinking process
behind it. So that's the most important

82
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
behind it. So that's the most important
 

83
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,869
behind it. So that's the most important
thing in this video is actually to

84
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
thing in this video is actually to
 

85
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,910
thing in this video is actually to
understand like how to think of

86
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
understand like how to think of
 

87
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,030
understand like how to think of
programmatic creative testing. Uh and at

88
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
programmatic creative testing. Uh and at
 

89
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,949
programmatic creative testing. Uh and at
the same time I'm going to show you the

90
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
the same time I'm going to show you the
 

91
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,910
the same time I'm going to show you the
system that I used I built for my

92
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
system that I used I built for my
 

93
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,750
system that I used I built for my
clients that they are currently using to

94
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
clients that they are currently using to
 

95
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,070
clients that they are currently using to
scale their ad accounts and find winning

96
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
scale their ad accounts and find winning
 

97
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,830
scale their ad accounts and find winning
ads after winning ads. Um and we will go

98
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
ads after winning ads. Um and we will go
 

99
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,190
ads after winning ads. Um and we will go
and we will see the different uh pieces

100
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
and we will see the different uh pieces
 

101
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,110
and we will see the different uh pieces
of the system one after the other. So

102
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
of the system one after the other. So
 

103
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,430
of the system one after the other. So
you will not only see a spreadsheet but

104
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
you will not only see a spreadsheet but
 

105
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,110
you will not only see a spreadsheet but
you will see a proper uh mental

106
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
you will see a proper uh mental
 

107
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,589
you will see a proper uh mental
framework that you can use. So who is it

108
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
framework that you can use. So who is it
 

109
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,670
framework that you can use. So who is it
for? Basically every company that is

110
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
for? Basically every company that is
 

111
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,229
for? Basically every company that is
running ads on Facebook can use this

112
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
running ads on Facebook can use this
 

113
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,390
running ads on Facebook can use this
system, this approach. If you are a

114
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
system, this approach. If you are a
 

115
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,869
system, this approach. If you are a
business owner, uh this might completely

116
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
business owner, uh this might completely
 

117
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,270
business owner, uh this might completely
change the way you think of running your

118
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
change the way you think of running your
 

119
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,470
change the way you think of running your
paid acquisition. If you are a marketer,

120
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
paid acquisition. If you are a marketer,
 

121
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,270
paid acquisition. If you are a marketer,
I think you will love it. And if you are

122
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
I think you will love it. And if you are
 

123
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,110
I think you will love it. And if you are
not yet at the scale of u scaling ads or

124
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
not yet at the scale of u scaling ads or
 

125
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,470
not yet at the scale of u scaling ads or
even running ads then it is worth keep

126
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
even running ads then it is worth keep
 

127
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,430
even running ads then it is worth keep
watching because what you will learn the

128
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
watching because what you will learn the
 

129
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,990
watching because what you will learn the
way to think of ads in a logical and

130
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
way to think of ads in a logical and
 

131
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,589
way to think of ads in a logical and
structural way will probably reframe uh

132
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
structural way will probably reframe uh
 

133
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,790
structural way will probably reframe uh
your approach uh so you will be a lot

134

your approach uh so you will be a lot
better of when you you get into it. So

dive into it. Just for context, the
 

155
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,030
dive into it. Just for context, the
system you're going to see in this video

156
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
system you're going to see in this video
 

157
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,750
system you're going to see in this video
is the exact reproduction of the system

158
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
is the exact reproduction of the system
 

159
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,309
is the exact reproduction of the system
I use for my client, but I did it for

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,949
I use for my client, but I did it for
the brand John Road Beauty, which is a

162
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
the brand John Road Beauty, which is a
 

163

D2C brand that a lot of people know. Uh,
 

165
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,630
D2C brand that a lot of people know. Uh,
and I used this product as an example.

166
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
and I used this product as an example.
 

167
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,190
and I used this product as an example.
So, this way I get to show it to you

168
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
So, this way I get to show it to you
 

169
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,589
So, this way I get to show it to you
without having to hide anything. And

170
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
without having to hide anything. And
 

171
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,830
without having to hide anything. And
again this system works for every type

172
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
again this system works for every type
 

173
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,190
again this system works for every type
of product uh whether it's e-commerce uh

174
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
of product uh whether it's e-commerce uh
 

175
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,229
of product uh whether it's e-commerce uh
consumer app SAS service whatever as

176
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
consumer app SAS service whatever as
 

177
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,310
consumer app SAS service whatever as
long as you can advertise on Facebook

178
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
long as you can advertise on Facebook
 

179
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,150
long as you can advertise on Facebook
but just for the sake of the example

180
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
but just for the sake of the example
 

181
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,990
but just for the sake of the example
remember that everything you will see is

182
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
remember that everything you will see is
 

183
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,350
remember that everything you will see is
for Jones beauty a D2C brand okay so

184
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
for Jones beauty a D2C brand okay so
 

185
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,830
for Jones beauty a D2C brand okay so
before showing you the actual system I

186
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
before showing you the actual system I
 

187
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,550
before showing you the actual system I
want to show you the mental framework um

188
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
want to show you the mental framework um
 

189
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,870
want to show you the mental framework um
so you understand how it works before

190
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
so you understand how it works before
 

191
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,270
so you understand how it works before
seeing it and I think it's the best way

192
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
seeing it and I think it's the best way
 

193
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,350
seeing it and I think it's the best way
because it's kind of a complex system to

194
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
because it's kind of a complex system to
 

195
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,990
because it's kind of a complex system to
to explain and I want it to be as simple

196
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
to explain and I want it to be as simple
 

197
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,710
to explain and I want it to be as simple
as possible so you you grab the main

198
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
as possible so you you grab the main
 

199
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,189
as possible so you you grab the main
idea not the the nitty-gritty of how it

200
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
idea not the the nitty-gritty of how it
 

201
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,350
idea not the the nitty-gritty of how it
works. So let's move on first to uh this

202
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
works. So let's move on first to uh this
 

203
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,510
works. So let's move on first to uh this
mental framework and then after that I

204
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
mental framework and then after that I
 

205
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,430
mental framework and then after that I
will show you the different pieces but

206
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
will show you the different pieces but
 

207
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,350
will show you the different pieces but
then every time I will show you a piece

208
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
then every time I will show you a piece
 

209
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,230
then every time I will show you a piece
you will know exactly what it means

210
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
you will know exactly what it means
 

211
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,749
you will know exactly what it means
within this framework. So when we talk

212
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
within this framework. So when we talk
 

213
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,430
within this framework. So when we talk
about um programmatic creative testing,

214
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
about um programmatic creative testing,
 

215
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,790
about um programmatic creative testing,
first of all we need to generate the

216
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
first of all we need to generate the
 

217
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,550
first of all we need to generate the
ads. And to generate the ads, what we

218
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
ads. And to generate the ads, what we
 

219
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,550
ads. And to generate the ads, what we
need is the full context about the

220
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
need is the full context about the
 

221
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,189
need is the full context about the
product. And to get the full context, we

222
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
product. And to get the full context, we
 

223
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,150
product. And to get the full context, we
need to give as much information as

224
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
need to give as much information as
 

225
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,550
need to give as much information as
possible to the AI we are going to use.

226
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
possible to the AI we are going to use.
 

227
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,710
possible to the AI we are going to use.
And for that we want the AI to

228
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
And for that we want the AI to
 

229
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,790
And for that we want the AI to
understand the brand. So we want a

230
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
understand the brand. So we want a
 

231
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,110
understand the brand. So we want a
proper brand description. We want the AI

232
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
proper brand description. We want the AI
 

233
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,270
proper brand description. We want the AI
to understand the product that we are

234
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
to understand the product that we are
 

235
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,430
to understand the product that we are
selling because it's always product by

236
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
selling because it's always product by
 

237
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,830
selling because it's always product by
product. Uh because you can't just

238
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
product. Uh because you can't just
 

239
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,350
product. Uh because you can't just
advertise a brand. You want to advertise

240
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
advertise a brand. You want to advertise
 

241
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,390
advertise a brand. You want to advertise
a product of course. And then we want to

242
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
a product of course. And then we want to
 

243
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,749
a product of course. And then we want to
give AI the voice of the customer. And

244
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
give AI the voice of the customer. And
 

245
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,950
give AI the voice of the customer. And
this one is probably the most important

246
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
this one is probably the most important
 

247
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,590
this one is probably the most important
because the ads that we are going to

248
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
because the ads that we are going to
 

249
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,749
because the ads that we are going to
create are going to be created with

250
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
create are going to be created with
 

251
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,710
create are going to be created with
using as much as possible the proper

252
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
using as much as possible the proper
 

253
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,590
using as much as possible the proper
wording that the customers are using

254
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
wording that the customers are using
 

255
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,469
wording that the customers are using
whether whether it's uh in the customer

256
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
whether whether it's uh in the customer
 

257
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,870
whether whether it's uh in the customer
reviews or if it's on forums or Reddit

258
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
reviews or if it's on forums or Reddit
 

259
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,990
reviews or if it's on forums or Reddit
uh wherever the customer is talking

260
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
uh wherever the customer is talking
 

261
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,469
uh wherever the customer is talking
about their pain we are going to gather

262
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
about their pain we are going to gather
 

263
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,469
about their pain we are going to gather
all this information and we feed it to

264
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
all this information and we feed it to
 

265
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,070
all this information and we feed it to
AI every time we generate new uh copy.

266
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
AI every time we generate new uh copy.
 

267
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,390
AI every time we generate new uh copy.
So that gives us the full context about

268
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
So that gives us the full context about
 

269
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,870
So that gives us the full context about
the product then from that we are using

270
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
the product then from that we are using
 

271
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,430
the product then from that we are using
AI or not to generate different unique

272
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
AI or not to generate different unique
 

273
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,749
AI or not to generate different unique
selling proposition. What are selling

274
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
selling proposition. What are selling
 

275
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,430
selling proposition. What are selling
proposition? Before you ask let's read a

276
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
proposition? Before you ask let's read a
 

277
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,070
proposition? Before you ask let's read a
short description so we are all aligned.

278
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
short description so we are all aligned.
 

279
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,110
short description so we are all aligned.
So a unique selling proposition USP is

280
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
So a unique selling proposition USP is
 

281
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,670
So a unique selling proposition USP is
your product's overall unique position

282
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
your product's overall unique position
 

283
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,830
your product's overall unique position
in the marketplace. The fundamental

284
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
in the marketplace. The fundamental
 

285
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,110
in the marketplace. The fundamental
promise that differentiates you from all

286
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
promise that differentiates you from all
 

287
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,150
promise that differentiates you from all
competitors. It's the big picture

288
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
competitors. It's the big picture
 

289
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,309
competitors. It's the big picture
identity that establishes what makes

290
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
identity that establishes what makes
 

291
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,670
identity that establishes what makes
your product uniquely valuable and why

292
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
your product uniquely valuable and why
 

293
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,550
your product uniquely valuable and why
customers should choose you over

294
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
customers should choose you over
 

295
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,870
customers should choose you over
alternatives. So this is basically you

296
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
alternatives. So this is basically you
 

297
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,150
alternatives. So this is basically you
don't have many unique thing

298
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
don't have many unique thing
 

299
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,550
don't have many unique thing
proposition. It's like one two three

300
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
proposition. It's like one two three
 

301
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,189
proposition. It's like one two three
four maximum. It's like the very thing

302
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
four maximum. It's like the very thing
 

303
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,909
four maximum. It's like the very thing
that you you that matter to your

304
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
that you you that matter to your
 

305
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,830
that you you that matter to your
customer and that differentiate you from

306
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
customer and that differentiate you from
 

307
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,990
customer and that differentiate you from
your competitors. So once we have all

308
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
your competitors. So once we have all
 

309
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,710
your competitors. So once we have all
the context uh then we can think of what

310
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
the context uh then we can think of what
 

311
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,589
the context uh then we can think of what
are our USPS and for each USP you have

312
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
are our USPS and for each USP you have
 

313
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,150
are our USPS and for each USP you have
different ways to talk about it that

314
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
different ways to talk about it that
 

315
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,790
different ways to talk about it that
where that's where we use marketing

316
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
where that's where we use marketing
 

317
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,270
where that's where we use marketing
angles and as you can see marketing

318
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
angles and as you can see marketing
 

319
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,589
angles and as you can see marketing
angles are related to a specific USB. So

320
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
angles are related to a specific USB. So
 

321
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,830
angles are related to a specific USB. So
the the overall thing is like you have

322
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
the the overall thing is like you have
 

323
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,909
the the overall thing is like you have
your product which you have different uh

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
your product which you have different uh
 

325
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,230
your product which you have different uh
unique selling propositions that each

a lot an infinity of marketing angles
 

331
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,189
a lot an infinity of marketing angles
that we can use to talk about this

00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
that we can use to talk about this
 

333
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,150
that we can use to talk about this
specific USP. And again quick definition

334
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
specific USP. And again quick definition
 

335
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,550

00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
angle takes one specific aspect of that
 

349
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,230
angle takes one specific aspect of that
USP and makes it the central message for

350
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
USP and makes it the central message for
 

351
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,629
USP and makes it the central message for
testing purposes. Each angle should be

00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
testing purposes. Each angle should be
 

353
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,350
testing purposes. Each angle should be
laser focused on a single emotional

I hope it's clear. Sorry for my reading

364
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
I hope it's clear. Sorry for my reading
 

365
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,949
I hope it's clear. Sorry for my reading
in English that is not the best but I

366
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
in English that is not the best but I
 

367
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,070
in English that is not the best but I
get I guess you understood. So once we

368
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
get I guess you understood. So once we
 

369
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,949
get I guess you understood. So once we
have this uh

370
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
have this uh
 

371
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,470
have this uh
we need to frame the message that we are

372
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
we need to frame the message that we are
 

373
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,630
we need to frame the message that we are
going to create and we can use specific

374
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
going to create and we can use specific
 

375
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,630
going to create and we can use specific
framework that we know work. So when we

376
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
framework that we know work. So when we
 

377
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,030
framework that we know work. So when we
want to push a specific unique selling

378
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
want to push a specific unique selling
 

379
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,230
want to push a specific unique selling
proposition using a specific angle then

380
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
proposition using a specific angle then
 

381
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,949
proposition using a specific angle then
now we can use a specific uh messaging

382
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
now we can use a specific uh messaging
 

383
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,790
now we can use a specific uh messaging
framework. I will show that uh a little

384
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
framework. I will show that uh a little
 

385
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,829
framework. I will show that uh a little
bit later in the video um and it will

386
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
bit later in the video um and it will
 

387
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,470
bit later in the video um and it will
become more clear but let's move on.

388
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
become more clear but let's move on.
 

389
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,590
become more clear but let's move on.
Then we need to define

390
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
Then we need to define
 

391
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,710
Then we need to define
what type of uh where where is the

392
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
what type of uh where where is the
 

393
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,949
what type of uh where where is the
customer at in their journey of becoming

394
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
customer at in their journey of becoming
 

395
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,949
customer at in their journey of becoming
a buyer. So this is the level of

396
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
a buyer. So this is the level of
 

397
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,509
a buyer. So this is the level of
awareness something that uh was

398
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
awareness something that uh was
 

399
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,230
awareness something that uh was
introduced by Eugene Schwartz which is a

400
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
introduced by Eugene Schwartz which is a
 

401
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,550
introduced by Eugene Schwartz which is a
very well-known copyriter that wrote

402
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
very well-known copyriter that wrote
 

403
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,630
very well-known copyriter that wrote
breakthrough advertising like every

404
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
breakthrough advertising like every
 

405
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,110
breakthrough advertising like every
copyriter out there know about that uh

406
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
copyriter out there know about that uh
 

407
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,070
copyriter out there know about that uh
but to talk about it quickly um you have

408
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
but to talk about it quickly um you have
 

409
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,630
but to talk about it quickly um you have
a market that is potentially buying your

410
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
a market that is potentially buying your
 

411
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,190
a market that is potentially buying your
product and depending of the product you

412
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
product and depending of the product you
 

413
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,030
product and depending of the product you
will have

414
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
will have
 

415
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,110
will have
the market will be segmented in

416
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
the market will be segmented in
 

417
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,310
the market will be segmented in
different aspect. So for example, if

418
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
different aspect. So for example, if
 

419
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,070
different aspect. So for example, if
something is uh is pretty niche, then

420
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
something is uh is pretty niche, then
 

421
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,269
something is uh is pretty niche, then
probably the people that are aware of

422
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
probably the people that are aware of
 

423
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,829
probably the people that are aware of
the solutions and aware of the problem

424
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
the solutions and aware of the problem
 

425
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,110
the solutions and aware of the problem
are a lot uh less than if we talk for

426
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
are a lot uh less than if we talk for
 

427
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,870
are a lot uh less than if we talk for
example like John Johns Rob Beauty

428
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
example like John Johns Rob Beauty
 

429
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,790
example like John Johns Rob Beauty
skincare is very well known. So we have

430
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
skincare is very well known. So we have
 

431
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,269
skincare is very well known. So we have
a lot of people that are solution aware

432
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
a lot of people that are solution aware
 

433
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,750
a lot of people that are solution aware
problem aware. Um, if you go from the

434
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
problem aware. Um, if you go from the
 

435
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,389
problem aware. Um, if you go from the
very beginning, unaware means, I don't

436
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
very beginning, unaware means, I don't
 

437
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,230
very beginning, unaware means, I don't
even know I have the problem. Problem

438
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
even know I have the problem. Problem
 

439
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,910
even know I have the problem. Problem
aware, I'm aware I have this problem,

440
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
aware, I'm aware I have this problem,
 

441
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,430
aware, I'm aware I have this problem,
but I I don't even know if there are

442
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
but I I don't even know if there are
 

443
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,150
but I I don't even know if there are
solutions. Solution aware is like, okay,

444
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
solutions. Solution aware is like, okay,
 

445
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,470
solutions. Solution aware is like, okay,
I I've heard about the solutions, didn't

446
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
I I've heard about the solutions, didn't
 

447
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,949
I I've heard about the solutions, didn't
really dig into it yet, but I'm I'm kind

448
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
really dig into it yet, but I'm I'm kind
 

449
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,870
really dig into it yet, but I'm I'm kind
of aware that I have a problem and

450
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
of aware that I have a problem and
 

451
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,949
of aware that I have a problem and
solutions exist. Product aware is

452
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
solutions exist. Product aware is
 

453
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,310
solutions exist. Product aware is
someone that already has uh dug into the

454
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
someone that already has uh dug into the
 

455
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,069
someone that already has uh dug into the
finding solutions and know a little bit

456
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
finding solutions and know a little bit
 

457
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,870
finding solutions and know a little bit
of the market. uh and most aware would

458
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
of the market. uh and most aware would
 

459
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,350
of the market. uh and most aware would
be the people that are aware about your

460
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
be the people that are aware about your
 

461
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,870
be the people that are aware about your
specific product. So it's always like a

462
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
specific product. So it's always like a
 

463
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,150
specific product. So it's always like a
very specific uh pieces of the market.

464
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
very specific uh pieces of the market.
 

465
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,389
very specific uh pieces of the market.

But when you create again when I I go
 

467
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,790
But when you create again when I I go
back here, we can push a unique selling

468

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
going to talk about it the same way if
 

477
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,230
going to talk about it the same way if
we talk about uh if we talk to someone

we talk about uh if we talk to someone
that is just aware that they have a

482
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
problem or if we talk to someone that is
 

483
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,470
problem or if we talk to someone that is
already uh very far along very far into

484
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
already uh very far along very far into
 

485
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,190
already uh very far along very far into
the journey of uh finding a solution for

486
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
the journey of uh finding a solution for
 

487
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,630
the journey of uh finding a solution for
this problem. So this is important to

488
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
this problem. So this is important to
 

489
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,710
this problem. So this is important to
give AI the information about who we are

490
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
give AI the information about who we are
 

491
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,550
give AI the information about who we are
talking to.

492
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
talking to.
 

493
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,069
talking to.
So with that said um we generate our

494
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
So with that said um we generate our
 

495
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,750
So with that said um we generate our
hooks because for the sake of this

496
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
hooks because for the sake of this
 

497
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,069
hooks because for the sake of this
example we are generating hooks. We

498
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
example we are generating hooks. We
 

499
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,389
example we are generating hooks. We
generate a bunch of them. We pick the

500
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
generate a bunch of them. We pick the
 

501
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,670
generate a bunch of them. We pick the
ones we like and then we generate an

502
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
ones we like and then we generate an
 

503
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,310
ones we like and then we generate an
image because we are the best way to

504
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
image because we are the best way to
 

505
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,350
image because we are the best way to
test a lot of ads at scale is to to use

506
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
test a lot of ads at scale is to to use
 

507
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,230
test a lot of ads at scale is to to use
static ads. Um video ads uh longer ads

508
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
static ads. Um video ads uh longer ads
 

509
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,630
static ads. Um video ads uh longer ads
are more complicated to produce and

510
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:52,640
are more complicated to produce and
 

511
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,430
are more complicated to produce and
static ads work really well. So we use a

512
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
static ads work really well. So we use a
 

513
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,870
static ads work really well. So we use a
combination of a hook based uh put on

514
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
combination of a hook based uh put on
 

515
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,509
combination of a hook based uh put on
different images uh that we are going to

516
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
different images uh that we are going to
 

517
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,910
different images uh that we are going to
push to the ad account uh and let

518
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
push to the ad account uh and let
 

519
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,230
push to the ad account uh and let
Facebook do its magic because the way we

520
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
Facebook do its magic because the way we
 

521
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,590
Facebook do its magic because the way we
are going to uh use uh to structure the

522
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
are going to uh use uh to structure the
 

523
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,470
are going to uh use uh to structure the
campaign on Facebook ads is by letting

524
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
campaign on Facebook ads is by letting
 

525
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,470
campaign on Facebook ads is by letting
the algorithm uh as much freedom as

526
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
the algorithm uh as much freedom as
 

527
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,350
the algorithm uh as much freedom as
possible. So Facebook will decide which

528
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
possible. So Facebook will decide which
 

529
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,750
possible. So Facebook will decide which
ads are resonating the most with your

530
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
ads are resonating the most with your
 

531
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,310
ads are resonating the most with your
customer.

532
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
customer.
 

533
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,310
customer.
So with that approach already uh you can

534
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
So with that approach already uh you can
 

535
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,750
So with that approach already uh you can
take it away. I'm not saying you should

536
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
take it away. I'm not saying you should
 

537
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,550
take it away. I'm not saying you should
stop the video, right? But just just

538
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
stop the video, right? But just just
 

539
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,750
stop the video, right? But just just
starting thinking about uh creating ads

540
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
starting thinking about uh creating ads
 

541
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,470
starting thinking about uh creating ads
in that way

542
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
in that way
 

543
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,030
in that way
is is already helpful because the the

544
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
is is already helpful because the the
 

545
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,430
is is already helpful because the the
one of the biggest problem of uh and

546
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
one of the biggest problem of uh and
 

547
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,509
one of the biggest problem of uh and
actually a lot of

548
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
actually a lot of
 

549
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,710
actually a lot of
marketing agencies uh don't have like a

550
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
marketing agencies uh don't have like a
 

551
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,269
marketing agencies uh don't have like a
structured way to to think of ads. So,

552
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
structured way to to think of ads. So,
 

553
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,990
structured way to to think of ads. So,
it's more creative. But again, um I'm

554
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
it's more creative. But again, um I'm
 

555
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,470
it's more creative. But again, um I'm
not I'm not a creative person. Uh I like

556
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
not I'm not a creative person. Uh I like
 

557
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,550
not I'm not a creative person. Uh I like
systems and I like to understand what

558
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
systems and I like to understand what
 

559
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,030
systems and I like to understand what
I'm doing. And if you start thinking of

560
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm doing. And if you start thinking of
 

561
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,870
I'm doing. And if you start thinking of
ads into in something that is not chaos,

562
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
ads into in something that is not chaos,
 

563
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,670
ads into in something that is not chaos,
it's it's logical. It's like when you

564
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
it's it's logical. It's like when you
 

565
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,670
it's it's logical. It's like when you
find uh everything that you see um in

566
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
find uh everything that you see um in
 

567
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,150
find uh everything that you see um in
pink right here, it's like after you've

568
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
pink right here, it's like after you've
 

569
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,030
pink right here, it's like after you've
tested so many of them, you know, after

570
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
tested so many of them, you know, after
 

571
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,870
tested so many of them, you know, after
you have

572
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
you have
 

573
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,790
you have
this, then you find the ones that are

574
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
this, then you find the ones that are
 

575
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,230
this, then you find the ones that are
actually uh resonating with your

576
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
actually uh resonating with your
 

577
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,310
actually uh resonating with your
customers and and they already exist.

578
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
customers and and they already exist.
 

579
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,750
customers and and they already exist.
You just have to find them. You just

580
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
You just have to find them. You just
 

581
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,670
You just have to find them. You just
have to find the right message, the the

582
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
have to find the right message, the the
 

583
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,750
have to find the right message, the the
right framework to speak to your

584
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
right framework to speak to your
 

585
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,670
right framework to speak to your
customer. And then once you have them

586
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
customer. And then once you have them
 

587
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,110
customer. And then once you have them
then you can one uh scale them as much

588
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
then you can one uh scale them as much
 

589
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,590
then you can one uh scale them as much
as you can and two you can iterate from

590
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
as you can and two you can iterate from
 

591
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,230
as you can and two you can iterate from
it to create better ads.

592
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
it to create better ads.
 

593
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,710
it to create better ads.
But now let's go back into the system.

594
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
But now let's go back into the system.
 

595
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,870
But now let's go back into the system.
So it will be a little bit more uh

596
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
So it will be a little bit more uh
 

597
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,829
So it will be a little bit more uh
technical. But uh now I want to show you

598
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
technical. But uh now I want to show you
 

599
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,870
technical. But uh now I want to show you
how you can actually uh automate all of

600
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
how you can actually uh automate all of
 

601
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,350
how you can actually uh automate all of
that. If you are an established business

602
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
that. If you are an established business
 

603
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,509
that. If you are an established business
and you would like to uh install this

604
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
and you would like to uh install this
 

605
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,150
and you would like to uh install this
system uh then I will put a link in the

606
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
system uh then I will put a link in the
 

607
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,150
system uh then I will put a link in the
description probably a quick form that

608
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
description probably a quick form that
 

609
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,030
description probably a quick form that
you can just uh fill out and so I will

610
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
you can just uh fill out and so I will

00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
talking about the context. Now here is a
 

619
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,670
talking about the context. Now here is a
spreadsheet as you recognized it's u

620
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
spreadsheet as you recognized it's u
 

621

it's in it's built within Google sheets
 

623
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,350
it's in it's built within Google sheets
and one spreadsheet can be used for um

624
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
and one spreadsheet can be used for um
 

625
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,470
and one spreadsheet can be used for um
one product basically and every of these

626
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
one product basically and every of these
 

627
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,629
one product basically and every of these
spreadsheets will be connected to a back

the data that we put within the

642
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
the data that we put within the
 

643
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,389
the data that we put within the
spreadsheet. So you can see brand

644
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
spreadsheet. So you can see brand
 

645
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,230
spreadsheet. So you can see brand
description, product description. It

646
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
description, product description. It
 

647
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,509
description, product description. It
gathers everything together and and in

648
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
gathers everything together and and in
 

649
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,430
gathers everything together and and in
the end it creates those huge prompts

650
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
the end it creates those huge prompts
 

651
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,069
the end it creates those huge prompts
that we are going to use either with

652
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
that we are going to use either with
 

653
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,750
that we are going to use either with
cloud or with uh chat GPT and put back

654
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
cloud or with uh chat GPT and put back
 

655
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,470
cloud or with uh chat GPT and put back
into the spreadsheet. So again the point

656
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
into the spreadsheet. So again the point
 

657
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,110
into the spreadsheet. So again the point
here is not to show you automations is

658
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
here is not to show you automations is
 

659
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,069
here is not to show you automations is
that you understand that this framework

660
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
that you understand that this framework
 

661
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,590
that you understand that this framework
this system uh is built into a

662
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
this system uh is built into a
 

663
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,910
this system uh is built into a
spreadsheet which is extremely simple

664
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
spreadsheet which is extremely simple
 

665
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,949
spreadsheet which is extremely simple
but every action that we do is run on

666
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
but every action that we do is run on
 

667
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,110
but every action that we do is run on
the back end uh through make.com

668
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
the back end uh through make.com
 

669
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,230
the back end uh through make.com
connected to the different APIs AIS that

670
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
connected to the different APIs AIS that
 

671
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,509
connected to the different APIs AIS that
we need to make it run. So let's go back

672
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
we need to make it run. So let's go back
 

673
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,069
we need to make it run. So let's go back
to the brand description here. we need

674
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
to the brand description here. we need
 

675
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,350
to the brand description here. we need
to input the the information that the

676
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
to input the the information that the
 

677
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,550
to input the the information that the
brand uh that we have about the brand.

678
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
brand uh that we have about the brand.
 

679
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,629
brand uh that we have about the brand.
So if you don't know anything about the

680
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
So if you don't know anything about the
 

681
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,550
So if you don't know anything about the
brand for example if it's not yours but

682
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
brand for example if it's not yours but
 

683
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,269
brand for example if it's not yours but
a client's brand then you can use uh

684
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
a client's brand then you can use uh
 

685
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,629
a client's brand then you can use uh
prompt. So we use predefined prompt uh

686
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
prompt. So we use predefined prompt uh
 

687
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,150
prompt. So we use predefined prompt uh
to have AI dig into the brand and uh

688
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
to have AI dig into the brand and uh
 

689
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,870
to have AI dig into the brand and uh
understand all the specificity of the

690
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
understand all the specificity of the
 

691
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,069
understand all the specificity of the
branding. Then you copy it and past it

692
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
branding. Then you copy it and past it
 

693
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,670
branding. Then you copy it and past it
into the right section. So the system

694
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
into the right section. So the system
 

695
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,389
into the right section. So the system
will take all that information and bring

696
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
will take all that information and bring
 

697
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,629
will take all that information and bring
it to the uh um the AI on the back end.

698
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
it to the uh um the AI on the back end.
 

699
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,269
it to the uh um the AI on the back end.
And I actually think that I showed you a

700
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
And I actually think that I showed you a
 

701
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,590
And I actually think that I showed you a
wrong one because that was the product

702
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
wrong one because that was the product
 

703
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,350
wrong one because that was the product
but it doesn't matter because this is

704
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
but it doesn't matter because this is
 

705
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,590
but it doesn't matter because this is
the exact same approach. Then you take

706
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
the exact same approach. Then you take
 

707
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,949
the exact same approach. Then you take
the product page and you feed AI with it

708
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
the product page and you feed AI with it
 

709
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,509
the product page and you feed AI with it
which uh will give you all the

710
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
which uh will give you all the
 

711
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,430
which uh will give you all the
information about specific product. So

712
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
information about specific product. So
 

713
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,030
information about specific product. So
the II know what exactly uh is the

714
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
the II know what exactly uh is the
 

715
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,189
the II know what exactly uh is the
product that it's advertising and then

716
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
product that it's advertising and then
 

717
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,670
product that it's advertising and then
now we have the gold nuggets and that is

718
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
now we have the gold nuggets and that is
 

719
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,829
now we have the gold nuggets and that is
the most uh interesting and important

720
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
the most uh interesting and important
 

721
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,710
the most uh interesting and important
thing. So either the the brand the

722
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
thing. So either the the brand the
 

723
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,990
thing. So either the the brand the
product already has customer reviews

724
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
product already has customer reviews
 

725
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,189
product already has customer reviews
then we would gather everything like um

726
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
then we would gather everything like um
 

727
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,829
then we would gather everything like um
take a huge piece of copy and pasted

728
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
take a huge piece of copy and pasted
 

729
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,829
take a huge piece of copy and pasted
text of the reviews give it to AI with

730
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
text of the reviews give it to AI with
 

731
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,189
text of the reviews give it to AI with
predefined prompt that will only keep

732
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
predefined prompt that will only keep
 

733
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,670
predefined prompt that will only keep
the the important quotes and then we

734
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
the the important quotes and then we
 

735
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,509
the the important quotes and then we
just copy them here the same way we have

736
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
just copy them here the same way we have
 

737
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,590
just copy them here the same way we have
done for brand and product description

738
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
done for brand and product description
 

739
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,829
done for brand and product description
but we also want to understand what

740
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
but we also want to understand what
 

741
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,390
but we also want to understand what
people are talking about on the internet

742
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
people are talking about on the internet
 

743
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,870
people are talking about on the internet
and for that I'm going to link in the

744
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
and for that I'm going to link in the
 

745
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,590
and for that I'm going to link in the
the description a video that is all

746
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
the description a video that is all
 

747
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,270
the description a video that is all
about the voice mining framework. So how

748
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
about the voice mining framework. So how
 

749
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,750
about the voice mining framework. So how
to to use all the available AI agents to

750
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
to to use all the available AI agents to
 

751
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,789
to to use all the available AI agents to
gather every sources on the internet and

752
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
gather every sources on the internet and
 

753
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,230
gather every sources on the internet and
create this kind of gold nuggets that

754
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
create this kind of gold nuggets that
 

755
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,029
create this kind of gold nuggets that
are basically uh here you have the

756
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
are basically uh here you have the
 

757
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,909
are basically uh here you have the
context about a specific painoint and

758
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
context about a specific painoint and
 

759
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,630
context about a specific painoint and
then you have all the different quotes

760
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
then you have all the different quotes
 

761
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,390
then you have all the different quotes
that people um have said things that

762
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
that people um have said things that
 

763
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,390
that people um have said things that
people have said on the internet about

764
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
people have said on the internet about
 

765
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,230
people have said on the internet about
this specific paint and it's not

766
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
this specific paint and it's not
 

767
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,270
this specific paint and it's not
obviously related to your product, but

768
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
obviously related to your product, but
 

769
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,510
obviously related to your product, but
this is related to your pain point. So

770
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
this is related to your pain point. So
 

771
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,270
this is related to your pain point. So
again, link in the description, there is

772
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
again, link in the description, there is
 

773
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,669
again, link in the description, there is
a full video about it and it teaches it

774
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
a full video about it and it teaches it
 

775
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,150
a full video about it and it teaches it
shows you how to really go from you have

776
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
shows you how to really go from you have
 

777
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,190
shows you how to really go from you have
no idea about what to um about marketing

778
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
no idea about what to um about marketing
 

779
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,230
no idea about what to um about marketing
at all to doing all the research prompt

780
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
at all to doing all the research prompt
 

781
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,549
at all to doing all the research prompt
after prompt after prompt using all the

782
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
after prompt after prompt using all the
 

783
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,830
after prompt after prompt using all the
AI agents and end up with a master

784
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
AI agents and end up with a master
 

785
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,190
AI agents and end up with a master
prompt that you can use for your

786
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
prompt that you can use for your
 

787
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,029
prompt that you can use for your
marketing. market research is only a

788
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
marketing. market research is only a
 

789
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,350
marketing. market research is only a
part of it that you can you can use it

790
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
part of it that you can you can use it
 

791
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,990
part of it that you can you can use it
for this specific purpose but otherwise

792
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
for this specific purpose but otherwise
 

793
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,230
for this specific purpose but otherwise
the the video will also show you how to

794
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
the the video will also show you how to
 

795
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,909
the the video will also show you how to
just generate marketing without even

796
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
just generate marketing without even
 

797
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,590
just generate marketing without even
using this system. So really encourage

798
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
using this system. So really encourage
 

799
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,230
using this system. So really encourage
you to to watch it. Anyway that was

800
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
you to to watch it. Anyway that was
 

801
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,190
you to to watch it. Anyway that was

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,190
literally impossible to overdo and it
describes this specific USB. And now

866
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
describes this specific USB. And now
 

867
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,549
describes this specific USB. And now
when I generate uh marketing angles

868
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559
when I generate uh marketing angles
 

869
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,669
when I generate uh marketing angles
here. So I will show you just for the

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
here. When I click here, it triggers a
 

875
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,909
here. When I click here, it triggers a
web hook. Technical thing. You don't

876
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
web hook. Technical thing. You don't
 

877
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,669
web hook. Technical thing. You don't
have to know that. But basically it

878
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
have to know that. But basically it
 

879
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,390
have to know that. But basically it
triggers one of the uh the automations

880
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
triggers one of the uh the automations
 

881
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,230
triggers one of the uh the automations
that I showed you on the back end that

882
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
that I showed you on the back end that
 

883
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,549
that I showed you on the back end that
is now uh generating the uh new

884
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
is now uh generating the uh new
 

885
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,470
is now uh generating the uh new
marketing angles for this specific USB.

886
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
marketing angles for this specific USB.
 

887
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,190

So there we have them, all the marketing

888
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
So there we have them, all the marketing
 

889
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,789
So there we have them, all the marketing
angles that I've generated so far. And

890
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
angles that I've generated so far. And
 

891
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,470
angles that I've generated so far. And
as you can see, they're all related to

892
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
as you can see, they're all related to
 

893
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,590
as you can see, they're all related to
one specific USB. So for the USB we were

894
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
one specific USB. So for the USB we were
 

895
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,590
one specific USB. So for the USB we were
talking about, the only makeup that's

896
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
talking about, the only makeup that's

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
literally impossible to overdo, you can
 

899
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,669
literally impossible to overdo, you can
say you can keep applying and it never

900
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
say you can keep applying and it never
 

901
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,549
say you can keep applying and it never
looks overdone. or if you go too strong

902
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
looks overdone. or if you go too strong
 

903
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,110
looks overdone. or if you go too strong
with other makeups, it soften back

904
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
with other makeups, it soften back
 

905
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,909
with other makeups, it soften back
softens it back to natural

906
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
softens it back to natural
 

907
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,669
softens it back to natural
or uh even in bad lighting or with shaky

908
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
or uh even in bad lighting or with shaky
 

909
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,390
or uh even in bad lighting or with shaky
hands, you still can't mess it up. And

910
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
hands, you still can't mess it up. And
 

911
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,430
hands, you still can't mess it up. And
then it also explains like this specific

912
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
then it also explains like this specific
 

913
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,510
then it also explains like this specific

talking about this unique selling
proposition. I hope I'm not losing you

918

919
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,029
proposition. I hope I'm not losing you
here. Um but it's very important

920
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
here. Um but it's very important
 

921
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,590
here. Um but it's very important
concept. It's what I was showing here on

922
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,600
concept. It's what I was showing here on
 

923
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,070
concept. It's what I was showing here on
the side. uh unique selling proposition

924
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
the side. uh unique selling proposition

the side. uh unique selling proposition
different marketing angles. So now that

926
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
different marketing angles. So now that
 

927
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,110
different marketing angles. So now that
we have them, let's see if we have

928
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
we have them, let's see if we have
 

929
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,909
we have them, let's see if we have
generated them. Not yet already, but it

930
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
generated them. Not yet already, but it
 

931
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,310
generated them. Not yet already, but it
doesn't matter. We don't need them. Uh

932
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
doesn't matter. We don't need them. Uh
 

933
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,990
doesn't matter. We don't need them. Uh
we arrive at the most important piece of

934
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
we arrive at the most important piece of
 

935
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,990
we arrive at the most important piece of
the system is where we are generating

936
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
the system is where we are generating
 

937
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,830
the system is where we are generating
the hooks. And as you can see here on

938
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
the hooks. And as you can see here on
 

939
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,190
the hooks. And as you can see here on
the left, I can pick the unique selling

940
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
the left, I can pick the unique selling
 

941
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,430
the left, I can pick the unique selling
proposition I want. And then I can pick

942
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
proposition I want. And then I can pick
 

943
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,669
proposition I want. And then I can pick
the marketing. So let's say this one

944
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
the marketing. So let's say this one
 

945
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,590
the marketing. So let's say this one
even in bad lighting or with shaky hands

946
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
even in bad lighting or with shaky hands
 

947
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,070
even in bad lighting or with shaky hands
you still can't mess it up and then I

948
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
you still can't mess it up and then I
 

949
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,470
you still can't mess it up and then I
have all the messaging frameworks that I

950
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
have all the messaging frameworks that I
 

951
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,710
have all the messaging frameworks that I
was talking about those messaging

952
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
was talking about those messaging

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,590
was talking about those messaging
framework they are

actually uh
 

1051
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,830
actually uh
be seen by a customer is by providing

1052
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
be seen by a customer is by providing
 

1053
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,230
be seen by a customer is by providing
something that is different that is

1054
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
something that is different that is
 

1055
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,470
something that is different that is
different from all the other competitors

1056
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
different from all the other competitors
 

1057
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,110
different from all the other competitors
that this specific customer want. It

1058
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
that this specific customer want. It
 

1059
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,110
that this specific customer want. It
kind of slightly differentiate the way

1060
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
kind of slightly differentiate the way
 

1061
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,830
kind of slightly differentiate the way
we talk. So for example here uh it's

1062
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
we talk. So for example here uh it's
 

1063
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,470
we talk. So for example here uh it's
skincare uh it's fourth level, fifth

1064
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
skincare uh it's fourth level, fifth
 

1065
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,510
skincare uh it's fourth level, fifth
level. Maybe if the product would be

1066
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
level. Maybe if the product would be
 

1067
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,149
level. Maybe if the product would be
like very innovative then we could say

1068
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
like very innovative then we could say
 

1069
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,070
like very innovative then we could say
okay that's third level. So, I don't

1070
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
okay that's third level. So, I don't
 

1071
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,230
okay that's third level. So, I don't
know. I I can't come up with creative

1072
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
know. I I can't come up with creative
 

1073
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,310
know. I I can't come up with creative
stuff, but I think you you know what I

1074
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
stuff, but I think you you know what I
 

1075
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,990
stuff, but I think you you know what I
mean.

1076
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
mean.
 

1077
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,149
mean.
You you don't have to use it, but it's

1078
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
You you don't have to use it, but it's
 

1079
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,470
You you don't have to use it, but it's
also a way to kind of uh changes

1080
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
also a way to kind of uh changes
 

1081
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,990
also a way to kind of uh changes
slightly the the message that you are

1082
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
slightly the the message that you are
 

1083
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,149
slightly the the message that you are
using. So, let's say third level or

1084
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
using. So, let's say third level or
 

1085
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,029
using. So, let's say third level or
fourth level and we are going to use um

1086
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
fourth level and we are going to use um
 

1087
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,070
fourth level and we are going to use um
punchy and we want u ch5

1088
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
punchy and we want u ch5
 

1089
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,510
punchy and we want u ch5
to use it. And then to create it what we

1090
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
to use it. And then to create it what we
 

1091
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,710
to use it. And then to create it what we
do is basically

1092
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
do is basically
 

1093
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,390
do is basically
we are going to drag that down

1094
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
we are going to drag that down
 

1095
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,669
we are going to drag that down
and change one variable if we want. We

1096
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
and change one variable if we want. We
 

1097
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,669
and change one variable if we want. We
can also just trying to try to create

1098
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
can also just trying to try to create
 

1099
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,190
can also just trying to try to create
that. But we can also say okay uh now I

1100
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
that. But we can also say okay uh now I
 

1101
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,430
that. But we can also say okay uh now I
don't want uh only this specific

1102
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
don't want uh only this specific
 

1103
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,830
don't want uh only this specific
messaging framework but I want to

1104
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
messaging framework but I want to
 

1105
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,350
messaging framework but I want to
generate

1106
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
generate
 

1107
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,990
generate
uh bold statements

1108
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
uh bold statements
 

1109
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,750
uh bold statements
here

1110
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
here
 

1111
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,230
here
and I want it I want the bold statements

1112
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
and I want it I want the bold statements
 

1113
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,269
and I want it I want the bold statements
to be actually standard. So this at this

1114
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
to be actually standard. So this at this
 

1115
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,750
to be actually standard. So this at this
point is for you or your team to think

1116
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
point is for you or your team to think
 

1117
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,390
point is for you or your team to think
of okay what are we testing in which

1118
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
of okay what are we testing in which
 

1119
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,710
of okay what are we testing in which
order and to generate uh one after the

1120
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
order and to generate uh one after the
 

1121
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,710
order and to generate uh one after the
other basically

1122
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
other basically
 

1123
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,070
other basically
and then let's uh put generate click

1124
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
and then let's uh put generate click
 

1125
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,230
and then let's uh put generate click
here which will trigger the web hook on

1126
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240
here which will trigger the web hook on
 

1127
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,710
here which will trigger the web hook on
the back end which will uh actually

1128
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
the back end which will uh actually
 

1129
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,789
the back end which will uh actually
generate the different hooks and now you

1130
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
generate the different hooks and now you
 

1131
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,590
generate the different hooks and now you
can see it's generating so we can go

1132
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
can see it's generating so we can go
 

1133
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,750
can see it's generating so we can go
back uh in a few minutes and we will

1134
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
back uh in a few minutes and we will
 

1135
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,710
back uh in a few minutes and we will
have the hooks here. Okay, so there we

1136
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
have the hooks here. Okay, so there we
 

1137
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,909
have the hooks here. Okay, so there we
have it. Um, it has it it took like one

1138
00:25:59,909 --> 00:25:59,919
have it. Um, it has it it took like one
 

1139
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,310
have it. Um, it has it it took like one
minute and uh at the same time I was

1140
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
minute and uh at the same time I was
 

1141
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,310
minute and uh at the same time I was
just looking into the other hooks and

1142
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
just looking into the other hooks and
 

1143
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,230
just looking into the other hooks and
try to find some interesting just to

1144
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
try to find some interesting just to
 

1145
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,230
try to find some interesting just to
show you. But those are the ones that

1146
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
show you. But those are the ones that
 

1147
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,110
show you. But those are the ones that
have been generated just now. Uh there

1148
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
have been generated just now. Uh there
 

1149
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,510
have been generated just now. Uh there
are some interesting uh beautiful even

1150
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
are some interesting uh beautiful even
 

1151
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,149
are some interesting uh beautiful even
when applied blind. Shaky hands steady

1152
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
when applied blind. Shaky hands steady
 

1153
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,950
when applied blind. Shaky hands steady
glows. Steady glow. So those are punchy.

1154
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960

1155
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,510

Miracle bombs makes mistake impossible

1158
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
Miracle bombs makes mistake impossible
 

1159
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,630
Miracle bombs makes mistake impossible
and glow inevitable. So that might not

1160
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
and glow inevitable. So that might not
 

1161
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,470
and glow inevitable. So that might not
be the the best ever hooks, the ever

1162
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
be the the best ever hooks, the ever
 

1163
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,029
be the the best ever hooks, the ever
written hooks, but they are pretty good.

1164
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
written hooks, but they are pretty good.
 

1165
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,110
written hooks, but they are pretty good.
And when you start having a long list

1166
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
And when you start having a long list
 

1167
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,029
And when you start having a long list
because believe me, you can have you can

1168
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
because believe me, you can have you can
 

1169
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,870
because believe me, you can have you can
generate a bunch of them and you go

1170
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
generate a bunch of them and you go
 

1171
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,110
generate a bunch of them and you go
through them. Now that's the moment

1172
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
through them. Now that's the moment
 

1173
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,510
through them. Now that's the moment
where you need someone that is that

1174
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
where you need someone that is that
 

1175
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,070
where you need someone that is that

without control it's like it generates
 

1189
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,029
without control it's like it generates
something and then you can select you

1190
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
something and then you can select you
 

1191
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,470
something and then you can select you
can even uh change it if you want but

1192
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
can even uh change it if you want but
 

1193
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,590
can even uh change it if you want but
then before generating the ads you are

1194
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
then before generating the ads you are
 

1195
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,149
then before generating the ads you are
going to have a human looking into

1196
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
going to have a human looking into
 

1197
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,110
going to have a human looking into
But okay uh let's say now we want to

1198
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
But okay uh let's say now we want to
 

1199
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,990
But okay uh let's say now we want to
create those ones. uh so I am just

1200
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
create those ones. uh so I am just
 

1201
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,390
create those ones. uh so I am just
creating generate and here I am going to

1202
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,400
creating generate and here I am going to
 

1203
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,870
creating generate and here I am going to
check the templates that I've created

1204
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
check the templates that I've created
 

1205
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,430
check the templates that I've created
and those templates I have created them

1206
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
and those templates I have created them
 

1207
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,870
and those templates I have created them
within this tool uh templated which

1208
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
within this tool uh templated which
 

1209
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,110
within this tool uh templated which
basically is a tool that you can access

1210
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
basically is a tool that you can access
 

1211
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,269
basically is a tool that you can access
through an API a little bit complicated

1212
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
through an API a little bit complicated
 

1213
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,470
through an API a little bit complicated
but you probably know what it is um that

1214
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
but you probably know what it is um that
 

1215
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,190
but you probably know what it is um that
allows to take an image and to generate

1216
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
allows to take an image and to generate
 

1217
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,990
allows to take an image and to generate
let me show you so I took a picture from

1218
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
let me show you so I took a picture from
 

1219
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,110
let me show you so I took a picture from
transport beauty. Here I hide the the

1220
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
transport beauty. Here I hide the the
 

1221
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,789
transport beauty. Here I hide the the
existing hook and here instead I put a

1222
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
existing hook and here instead I put a
 

1223
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,669
existing hook and here instead I put a
text and this text is just a sample here

1224
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
text and this text is just a sample here
 

1225
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,590
text and this text is just a sample here
but it will be replaced by every hook

1226
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
but it will be replaced by every hook
 

1227
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,710
but it will be replaced by every hook
that I'm using here. So we will have the

1228
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
that I'm using here. So we will have the
 

1229
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,230
that I'm using here. So we will have the
same picture but then it will be

1230
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
same picture but then it will be
 

1231
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,070
same picture but then it will be
replaced by that. So if I look at here,

1232
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,080
replaced by that. So if I look at here,
 

1233
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,590
replaced by that. So if I look at here,
uh it also handle the size of the the

1234
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
uh it also handle the size of the the
 

1235
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,029
uh it also handle the size of the the
font depending on the size of the uh the

1236
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:15,039
font depending on the size of the uh the
 

1237
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,710
font depending on the size of the uh the
actual hook. It's auto fit here and it

1238
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
actual hook. It's auto fit here and it
 

1239
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,870
actual hook. It's auto fit here and it
will fill the hat uh which will be uh

1240
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
will fill the hat uh which will be uh
 

1241
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,549
will fill the hat uh which will be uh
important for us because this one for

1242
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
important for us because this one for
 

1243
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,789
important for us because this one for
example is long but we are going to have

1244
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
example is long but we are going to have
 

1245
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,630
example is long but we are going to have
like shorter hooks and this is what

1246
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
like shorter hooks and this is what
 

1247
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,750
like shorter hooks and this is what
works in the back end that we can get.

1248
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
works in the back end that we can get.
 

1249
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,630
works in the back end that we can get.
Uh here we create the templates and we

1250
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
Uh here we create the templates and we
 

1251
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,750
Uh here we create the templates and we
decide to use um one or other another

1252
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
decide to use um one or other another
 

1253
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,149
decide to use um one or other another
template. But basically you have you can

1254
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
template. But basically you have you can
 

1255
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,230
template. But basically you have you can
have a creative team or you can go ahead

1256
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
have a creative team or you can go ahead
 

1257
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,750
have a creative team or you can go ahead
and create a bunch of different

1258
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
and create a bunch of different
 

1259
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,630
and create a bunch of different
templates of ads that you know will work

1260
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
templates of ads that you know will work
 

1261
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,990
templates of ads that you know will work
and apply the hooks that you generate on

1262
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
and apply the hooks that you generate on
 

1263
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,909
and apply the hooks that you generate on
those templates. So now let's just

1264
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
those templates. So now let's just
 

1265
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,310
those templates. So now let's just
create them. So we have a long one and

1266
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
create them. So we have a long one and
 

1267
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,909
create them. So we have a long one and
two short ones. Let's go

1268
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
two short ones. Let's go
 

1269
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,909
two short ones. Let's go
and we move on to add creation. Here

1270
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
and we move on to add creation. Here
 

1271
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,630
and we move on to add creation. Here
they are.

1272
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640

 

1273
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,669

And as you can see here,

1274
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:11,679
And as you can see here,
 

1275
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,510
And as you can see here,
shaking hand. And it looks fresh, not

1276
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
shaking hand. And it looks fresh, not
 

1277
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,669
shaking hand. And it looks fresh, not
fake.

1278
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
fake.
 

1279
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,190
fake.
And it creates. So why it creates two

1280
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
And it creates. So why it creates two
 

1281
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,990
And it creates. So why it creates two
six while I had three hooks I wanted to

1282
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
six while I had three hooks I wanted to
 

1283
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,549
six while I had three hooks I wanted to
create simply because I activated two

1284
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:24,559
create simply because I activated two
 

1285
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,630
create simply because I activated two
templates. So for each hook, it will

1286
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
templates. So for each hook, it will
 

1287
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,510
templates. So for each hook, it will
create two variations.

1288
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
create two variations.
 

1289
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,310
create two variations.
Uh let me show you a longer one here.

1290
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
Uh let me show you a longer one here.
 

1291
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,310
Uh let me show you a longer one here.
For example,

1292
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
For example,
 

1293
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,710
For example,
no mirror, no problem. Miracle bombs

1294
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
no mirror, no problem. Miracle bombs
 

1295
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,630
no mirror, no problem. Miracle bombs
makes mistake impossible and glow

1296
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
makes mistake impossible and glow
 

1297
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,190
makes mistake impossible and glow
inevitable. Awesome. That's exactly what

1298
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
inevitable. Awesome. That's exactly what
 

1299
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,350
inevitable. Awesome. That's exactly what
we want.

1300
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
we want.
 

1301
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,669
we want.
All right. And now we are we are in this

1302
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
All right. And now we are we are in this
 

1303
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,389
All right. And now we are we are in this
ad creation part of the system and we

1304
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
ad creation part of the system and we
 

1305
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,470
ad creation part of the system and we
can simply move on and create the ads.

1306
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
can simply move on and create the ads.
 

1307
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,029
can simply move on and create the ads.
So let's say I want to create first of

1308
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:53,039
So let's say I want to create first of
 

1309
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,310
So let's say I want to create first of
all I need to select the different the

1310
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
all I need to select the different the
 

1311
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,909
all I need to select the different the
adset I want to put those ads in. So I

1312
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
adset I want to put those ads in. So I
 

1313
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,070
adset I want to put those ads in. So I
need to first create the campaign and

1314
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
need to first create the campaign and
 

1315
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,950
need to first create the campaign and
then create the different adsets. It's

1316
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
then create the different adsets. It's
 

1317
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,470
then create the different adsets. It's
it's possible to create the adsets

1318
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
it's possible to create the adsets
 

1319
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,110
it's possible to create the adsets
automatically but we ended up realizing

1320
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
automatically but we ended up realizing
 

1321
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,669
automatically but we ended up realizing
that it was a lot better to give the

1322
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
that it was a lot better to give the
 

1323
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,510
that it was a lot better to give the
freedom to create the structure of the

1324
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
freedom to create the structure of the
 

1325
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,389
freedom to create the structure of the
campaign and only push the ads within

1326
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
campaign and only push the ads within
 

1327
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,630
campaign and only push the ads within
the adset that have been created

1328
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:18,640
the adset that have been created
 

1329
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,029
the adset that have been created
already. So for the sake of this example

1330
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
already. So for the sake of this example
 

1331
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,789
already. So for the sake of this example
I create adset one. So again there is an

1332
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
I create adset one. So again there is an
 

1333
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,269
I create adset one. So again there is an
automation that basically retrive the

1334
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:27,279
automation that basically retrive the
 

1335
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,190
automation that basically retrive the
adset that are existing in a specific

1336
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
adset that are existing in a specific
 

1337
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,710
adset that are existing in a specific
campaign and then I'm creating the ads.

1338
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
campaign and then I'm creating the ads.
 

1339
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,830
campaign and then I'm creating the ads.
So same thing

1340
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:35,840
So same thing
 

1341
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,710
So same thing
to create I click here triggers a web

1342
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
to create I click here triggers a web
 

1343
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,070
to create I click here triggers a web
hook and it starts creating the ads on

1344
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
hook and it starts creating the ads on
 

1345
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,269
hook and it starts creating the ads on
the back end.

1346
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
the back end.
 

1347
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,149
the back end.
So we can see so there are a lot of uh

1348
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
So we can see so there are a lot of uh
 

1349
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,990
So we can see so there are a lot of uh
waiting time here. So I'm going to pause

1350
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
waiting time here. So I'm going to pause
 

1351
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,870
waiting time here. So I'm going to pause
but because the if you create too many

1352
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
but because the if you create too many
 

1353
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,350
but because the if you create too many
ads at the same time then Facebook at

1354
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
ads at the same time then Facebook at
 

1355
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,990
ads at the same time then Facebook at
some point says it's enough. So as you

1356
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
some point says it's enough. So as you
 

1357
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,789
some point says it's enough. So as you
can see it works slowly but you can just

1358
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
can see it works slowly but you can just
 

1359
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,590
can see it works slowly but you can just
uh put 100 ads and then it will create

1360
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
uh put 100 ads and then it will create
 

1361
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,590
uh put 100 ads and then it will create
them one by one and then you can go

1362
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
them one by one and then you can go
 

1363
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,389
them one by one and then you can go
ahead later and check them out. So if I

1364
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
ahead later and check them out. So if I
 

1365
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,990
ahead later and check them out. So if I
go here so this is a old um

1366
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
go here so this is a old um
 

1367
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,350
go here so this is a old um
ad uh account that I was using. Let me

1368
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
ad uh account that I was using. Let me
 

1369
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,669
ad uh account that I was using. Let me
just find them. Programmative testing

1370
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,679
just find them. Programmative testing
 

1371
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,750
just find them. Programmative testing
ads set one. And here we have our ads.

1372
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
ads set one. And here we have our ads.
 

1373
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,549
ads set one. And here we have our ads.
Shaky hand steady glow is the picture we

1374
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
Shaky hand steady glow is the picture we
 

1375
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,269
Shaky hand steady glow is the picture we
wanted. And you can obviously use the

1376
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
wanted. And you can obviously use the
 

1377
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,430
wanted. And you can obviously use the
format that you want and so on and so

1378
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
format that you want and so on and so
 

1379
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,269
format that you want and so on and so
forth. So it's for you to decide which

1380
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:33,279
forth. So it's for you to decide which
 

1381
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,110
forth. So it's for you to decide which
campaign you use, what are the

1382
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
campaign you use, what are the
 

1383
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,990
campaign you use, what are the
structures of your adset and what ad you

1384
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,000
structures of your adset and what ad you
 

1385
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,149
structures of your adset and what ad you
want to push in each adset. Okay. So

1386
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
want to push in each adset. Okay. So
 

1387
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,470
want to push in each adset. Okay. So
there we go. We have ads running at this

1388
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
there we go. We have ads running at this
 

1389
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,669
there we go. We have ads running at this
point. So imagine you have 100 ads. Um,

1390
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
point. So imagine you have 100 ads. Um,
 

1391
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,070
point. So imagine you have 100 ads. Um,
Facebook decides which ones are the good

1392
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080
Facebook decides which ones are the good
 

1393
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,750
Facebook decides which ones are the good
ones, the ones that resonate with the

1394
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
ones, the ones that resonate with the
 

1395
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,149
ones, the ones that resonate with the
customer. You find one or two winners

1396
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
customer. You find one or two winners
 

1397
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,830
customer. You find one or two winners
and then you come back here and you say,

1398
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
and then you come back here and you say,
 

1399
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,710
and then you come back here and you say,
"Okay, those ones are my winners." So,

1400
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
"Okay, those ones are my winners." So,
 

1401
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,110
"Okay, those ones are my winners." So,
what's the next step? Again, u I

1402
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
what's the next step? Again, u I
 

1403
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,549
what's the next step? Again, u I
mentioned it earlier, but you can

1404
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
mentioned it earlier, but you can
 

1405
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,830
mentioned it earlier, but you can
iterate. So, if you know that uh this ad

1406
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
iterate. So, if you know that uh this ad
 

1407
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,990
iterate. So, if you know that uh this ad
was a winner, then you know that this

1408
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
was a winner, then you know that this
 

1409
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,350
was a winner, then you know that this
angle pushing this USB, it works. So why

1410
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
angle pushing this USB, it works. So why
 

1411
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,630
angle pushing this USB, it works. So why
don't you just uh create new um

1412
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
don't you just uh create new um
 

1413
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,990
don't you just uh create new um
iteration of this? You can use new uh

1414
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
iteration of this? You can use new uh
 

1415
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,110
iteration of this? You can use new uh
imaging images uh with the same hooks.

1416
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
imaging images uh with the same hooks.
 

1417
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,149
imaging images uh with the same hooks.
You can use different ways to talk about

1418
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
You can use different ways to talk about
 

1419
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,389
You can use different ways to talk about
this specific marketing angle. But you

1420
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
this specific marketing angle. But you
 

1421
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,630
this specific marketing angle. But you
can basically iterate again and again to

1422
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
can basically iterate again and again to
 

1423
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,029
can basically iterate again and again to
push the same thing. That is only if you

1424
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
push the same thing. That is only if you
 

1425
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,070
push the same thing. That is only if you
use static ads. But what if you want to

1426
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
use static ads. But what if you want to
 

1427
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,909
use static ads. But what if you want to
do more about that? Then this is the

1428
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:35,919
do more about that? Then this is the
 

1429
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,029
do more about that? Then this is the
next step. This is a system that is

1430
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039
next step. This is a system that is
 

1431
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,509
next step. This is a system that is
going to create a mini VSSL or a

1432

1435
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,669
textbased uh ad like something longer
that is written specifically based on

1436
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
that is written specifically based on
 

1437
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,990
that is written specifically based on
the hook that was performing. So, but

1438
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
the hook that was performing. So, but
 

1439
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,509
the hook that was performing. So, but
basically

1440
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
basically
 

1441
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,430
basically
we are using u different parameters from

1442
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
we are using u different parameters from
 

1443
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,909
we are using u different parameters from
the ones that we have used for the hooks

1444
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:57,919
the ones that we have used for the hooks
 

1445
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,070
the ones that we have used for the hooks
but some are the same. You still have

1446
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
but some are the same. You still have
 

1447
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,549
but some are the same. You still have
the USB that you want to use. You still

1448
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
the USB that you want to use. You still
 

1449
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,710
the USB that you want to use. You still
have the marketing angle. it was this

1450
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
have the marketing angle. it was this
 

1451
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,470
have the marketing angle. it was this
one the original hook. So let's say that

1452
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
one the original hook. So let's say that
 

1453
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,509
one the original hook. So let's say that
was my hook that was performing then I

1454
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
was my hook that was performing then I
 

1455
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,750
was my hook that was performing then I
will create I will take an an ad as an

1456
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
will create I will take an an ad as an
 

1457
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,909
will create I will take an an ad as an
inspiration. So here's a bunch of ads

1458
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
inspiration. So here's a bunch of ads
 

1459
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,630
inspiration. So here's a bunch of ads
that are known for performing. So let's

1460
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
that are known for performing. So let's
 

1461
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,430
that are known for performing. So let's
say I take this one and I want to select

1462
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
say I take this one and I want to select
 

1463
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,470
say I take this one and I want to select
a psychological trigger. Uh let's say

1464
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,480
a psychological trigger. Uh let's say
 

1465
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,750

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,389
fourth level sophistication market and I
want chat GPT5 to create it. So, I'm

1488
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
want chat GPT5 to create it. So, I'm
 

1489
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,069
want chat GPT5 to create it. So, I'm
generating it and you will see the

1490
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,079
generating it and you will see the
 

1491
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,430
generating it and you will see the
result right away up. It's generating

1492
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,440
result right away up. It's generating
 

1493
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,349
result right away up. It's generating
done. It took only a few seconds. So,

1494
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
done. It took only a few seconds. So,
 

1495
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,510
done. It took only a few seconds. So,
you have the hook, the the lid, the

1496
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,520
you have the hook, the the lid, the
 

1497
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,869
you have the hook, the the lid, the
body, and the CTA. But to visualize it a

1498
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
body, and the CTA. But to visualize it a
 

1499
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,869
body, and the CTA. But to visualize it a
little bit better and to modify, then

1500
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
little bit better and to modify, then
 

1501
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,149
little bit better and to modify, then
you can u use that. It's a Google doc.

1502
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
you can u use that. It's a Google doc.
 

1503
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,230
you can u use that. It's a Google doc.
And this is basically your hook. It

1504
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
And this is basically your hook. It
 

1505
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,069
And this is basically your hook. It
always makes it in a way that's possible

1506
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:30,079
always makes it in a way that's possible
 

1507
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,230
always makes it in a way that's possible
to to speak it. So basically, you can

1508
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,240
to to speak it. So basically, you can
 

1509
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,349
to to speak it. So basically, you can
use this script to create a voice over

1510
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
use this script to create a voice over
 

1511
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,829
use this script to create a voice over
with B-roll ad. So no mirror, no

00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
went on too strong. never panicking
 

1521
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,349
went on too strong. never panicking
under the harsh office light that you

1522
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:49,359
under the harsh office light that you
 

1523
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,669
under the harsh office light that you
you can read it yourself. It's an ad

1524
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
you can read it yourself. It's an ad
 

1525
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,589
you can read it yourself. It's an ad
that is um again it can be modified but

1526
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
that is um again it can be modified but
 

1527
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,710
that is um again it can be modified but
this is a very good start that uses all

1528
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,720
this is a very good start that uses all
 

1529
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,870
this is a very good start that uses all
the parameters that you want and you

1530
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,880
the parameters that you want and you
 

1531
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,430
the parameters that you want and you
have a script you can um you can run

1532
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
have a script you can um you can run
 

1533
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,069
have a script you can um you can run
with. What do you do with this script?

1534
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
with. What do you do with this script?
 

1535
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,670
with. What do you do with this script?
That's a good question and as I said

1536
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680
That's a good question and as I said
 

1537
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,829
That's a good question and as I said
it's still in the building. Uh I'm still

1538
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
it's still in the building. Uh I'm still
 

1539
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,990
it's still in the building. Uh I'm still
thinking of how we can automatically

1540
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
thinking of how we can automatically
 

1541
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,750
thinking of how we can automatically
create uh the ad with the B- rolls that

1542
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
create uh the ad with the B- rolls that
 

1543
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,550
create uh the ad with the B- rolls that
are available uh all the videos that the

1544
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,560
are available uh all the videos that the
 

1545
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,150
are available uh all the videos that the
brand have. Uh not there yet. So far the

1546
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
brand have. Uh not there yet. So far the
 

1547
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,630
brand have. Uh not there yet. So far the
only um the best way I found is to use

1548
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,640
only um the best way I found is to use
 

1549
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,910
only um the best way I found is to use
icon this specific product within icon.

1550
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
icon this specific product within icon.
 

1551
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,990
icon this specific product within icon.
I'll put the link in the description. Uh

1552
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
I'll put the link in the description. Uh
 

1553
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,670
I'll put the link in the description. Uh
but basically it's it allows to import

1554
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
but basically it's it allows to import
 

1555
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,109
but basically it's it allows to import
all your bureaus and just start with a

1556
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
all your bureaus and just start with a
 

1557
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,430
all your bureaus and just start with a
script. So you just take your script

1558
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,440
script. So you just take your script
 

1559
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,670
script. So you just take your script
that was written for you, put it into

1560
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
that was written for you, put it into
 

1561
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,390
that was written for you, put it into
this tool and then it will segment it in

1562
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
this tool and then it will segment it in
 

1563
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,630
this tool and then it will segment it in
different pieces, different sentences

1564
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
different pieces, different sentences
 

1565
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,510
different pieces, different sentences
and for each of them it will offer it

1566
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,520
and for each of them it will offer it
 

1567
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,829
and for each of them it will offer it
will find the the B-roll that you

1568
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
will find the the B-roll that you
 

1569
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,390
will find the the B-roll that you
already have that fits the best to the

1570
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,400
already have that fits the best to the
 

1571
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,550
already have that fits the best to the
specific piece of the script. So you can

1572
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
specific piece of the script. So you can
 

1573
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,390
specific piece of the script. So you can
have a very fast process. It's not

1574
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
have a very fast process. It's not
 

1575
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,950
have a very fast process. It's not
completely automated yet, but you can

1576
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
completely automated yet, but you can
 

1577
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,349
completely automated yet, but you can
generate uh scripts at scale scale quote

1578
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:07,359
generate uh scripts at scale scale quote
 

1579
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,750
generate uh scripts at scale scale quote
unquote based on specific parameters you

1580
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
unquote based on specific parameters you
 

1581
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,390
unquote based on specific parameters you
want to test. Take those scripts, put

1582
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,400
want to test. Take those scripts, put
 

1583
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,230
want to test. Take those scripts, put
them into icon and have someone that is

1584
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
them into icon and have someone that is
 

1585

as a a creative guesswork that is

1604
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
as a a creative guesswork that is
 

1605
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,150
as a a creative guesswork that is
completely chaotic but instead you see

1606
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,160
completely chaotic but instead you see
 

1607
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,870
completely chaotic but instead you see
it as okay we actually can make a system

1608
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
it as okay we actually can make a system
 

1609
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,109
it as okay we actually can make a system
out of it. We actually can use different

1610
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
out of it. We actually can use different
 

1611
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,190
out of it. We actually can use different
parameters that we can test in a

1612
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
parameters that we can test in a
 

1613
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,030
parameters that we can test in a
structured way. So we will we will

1614
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
structured way. So we will we will
 

1615
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,910
structured way. So we will we will
logically find the right combination

1616
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
logically find the right combination
 

1617
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,310
