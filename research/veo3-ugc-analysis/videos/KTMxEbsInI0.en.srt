Hello and welcome. In this video, I'll

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
Hello and welcome. In this video, I'll
 

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,909
Hello and welcome. In this video, I'll
show you exactly how you can take any

4
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
show you exactly how you can take any
 

5
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,789
show you exactly how you can take any
product and turn it into viral UGC ads

6
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
product and turn it into viral UGC ads
 

7
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,750
product and turn it into viral UGC ads
using V3 and Google's brand new model,

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
using V3 and Google's brand new model,
 

9
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,910
using V3 and Google's brand new model,
Nano Banana. The process is simple,

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
Nano Banana. The process is simple,
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,230
Nano Banana. The process is simple,
fast, and repeatable. So, you can test,

12
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
fast, and repeatable. So, you can test,
 

13
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,070
fast, and repeatable. So, you can test,
iterate, and actually start to create

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
iterate, and actually start to create
 

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,550
iterate, and actually start to create
ads that convert. So, if you're ready to

16
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
ads that convert. So, if you're ready to
 

17
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,510
ads that convert. So, if you're ready to
go, let's get started. Now, to create

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
go, let's get started. Now, to create
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,509
go, let's get started. Now, to create
our UGC ads, I've broken the process

20
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
our UGC ads, I've broken the process
 

21
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,750
our UGC ads, I've broken the process
down to three simple steps. First, we'll

22
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
down to three simple steps. First, we'll
 

23
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,349
down to three simple steps. First, we'll
start by picking the product. This could

24
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
start by picking the product. This could
 

25
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,710
start by picking the product. This could
be something that you already are

26
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
be something that you already are
 

27
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,109
be something that you already are
selling or just some random product if

28
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
selling or just some random product if
 

29
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,030
selling or just some random product if
you want to practice. I'll show you how

30
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
you want to practice. I'll show you how
 

31
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,670
you want to practice. I'll show you how
to break that product down into scripts

32
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
to break that product down into scripts
 

33
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,150
to break that product down into scripts
and angles that actually make sense for

34
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
and angles that actually make sense for
 

35
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,990
and angles that actually make sense for
marketing. Next, we'll create the

36
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
marketing. Next, we'll create the
 

37
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,630
marketing. Next, we'll create the
scenes. So, we will generate images for

38
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
scenes. So, we will generate images for
 

39
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,630
scenes. So, we will generate images for
our ads. These aren't just random

40
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
our ads. These aren't just random
 

41
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,630
our ads. These aren't just random
pictures. We're going to design proper

42
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
pictures. We're going to design proper
 

43
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,430
pictures. We're going to design proper
ad scenes using Nano Banana, which can

44
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
ad scenes using Nano Banana, which can
 

45
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,670
ad scenes using Nano Banana, which can
create avatars holding products and

46
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
create avatars holding products and
 

47
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,430
create avatars holding products and
looking super realistic. And then

48
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
looking super realistic. And then
 

49
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,350
looking super realistic. And then
finally, we'll take those images to

50
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
finally, we'll take those images to
 

51
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,350
finally, we'll take those images to
generate our videos. Then we'll stitch

52
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
generate our videos. Then we'll stitch
 

53
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,830
generate our videos. Then we'll stitch
them together into complete ads. By the

54
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
them together into complete ads. By the
 

55
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,229
them together into complete ads. By the
end, you'll know exactly how to go from

56
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
end, you'll know exactly how to go from
 

57
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,390
end, you'll know exactly how to go from
nothing to a finished ad. All created

58
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
nothing to a finished ad. All created
 

59
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,670
nothing to a finished ad. All created
using Google's V3 and Nano Banana. And

60
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
using Google's V3 and Nano Banana. And
 

61
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,190
using Google's V3 and Nano Banana. And
the best part, once you learn this

62
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
the best part, once you learn this
 

63
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,270
the best part, once you learn this
process, you can repeat it with any

64
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
process, you can repeat it with any
 

65
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,590
process, you can repeat it with any
product and scale it up as much as you

66
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
product and scale it up as much as you
 

67
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,390
product and scale it up as much as you
want. So, let's get going and start

68
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
want. So, let's get going and start
 

69
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,149
want. So, let's get going and start
finding our first product. I just went

70
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
finding our first product. I just went
 

71
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,990
finding our first product. I just went
to Perplexity and searched what's the

72
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
to Perplexity and searched what's the
 

73
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,149
to Perplexity and searched what's the
most trending products this month. It

74
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
most trending products this month. It
 

75
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,990
most trending products this month. It
gave me a list and I picked the one that

76
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
gave me a list and I picked the one that
 

77
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,749
gave me a list and I picked the one that
stood out. So, I went ahead with the

78
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
stood out. So, I went ahead with the
 

79
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,310
stood out. So, I went ahead with the
smart water bottles and found a brand

80
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
smart water bottles and found a brand
 

81
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,469
smart water bottles and found a brand
that could potentially be a good fit for

82
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
that could potentially be a good fit for
 

83
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,030
that could potentially be a good fit for
what we're trying to do. So, I did some

84
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
what we're trying to do. So, I did some
 

85
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,789
what we're trying to do. So, I did some
research and I found this brand. It's

86
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
research and I found this brand. It's
 

87
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,030
research and I found this brand. It's
called Hydrate Spark and it could be

88
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
called Hydrate Spark and it could be
 

89
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,270
called Hydrate Spark and it could be
very trendable because they have this

90
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
very trendable because they have this
 

91
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,310
very trendable because they have this
LED light on the bottom and it seems

92
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
LED light on the bottom and it seems
 

93
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,550
LED light on the bottom and it seems
like a quality product. It's also very

94
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
like a quality product. It's also very
 

95
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,789
like a quality product. It's also very
simple to show in someone's hand and it

96
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
simple to show in someone's hand and it
 

97
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,109
simple to show in someone's hand and it
works well in all settings. That means

98
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
works well in all settings. That means
 

99
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,350
works well in all settings. That means
we can test a lot of ad angles and try

100
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
we can test a lot of ad angles and try
 

101
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,350
we can test a lot of ad angles and try
multiple avatars, which makes this

102
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
multiple avatars, which makes this
 

103
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,510
multiple avatars, which makes this
product a perfect demo. Once we're on

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,270
ideas. So this will work for our base to
create our ads from. Now that we have

160
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
create our ads from. Now that we have
 

161
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,430
create our ads from. Now that we have
run the product analyzis, it's time to

162
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
run the product analyzis, it's time to
 

163
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,350
run the product analyzis, it's time to
turn that information into scripts,

164
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
turn that information into scripts,
 

165
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,509
turn that information into scripts,
avatars, and prompts for our ads. We'll

166
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
avatars, and prompts for our ads. We'll
 

167
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,430
avatars, and prompts for our ads. We'll
grab the second prompt I've prepared in

168
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
grab the second prompt I've prepared in
 

169
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,990
grab the second prompt I've prepared in
the Google Docs. I'll just copy paste

170
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
the Google Docs. I'll just copy paste
 

171
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,309
the Google Docs. I'll just copy paste
this one. This way, GPT keeps the

172
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
this one. This way, GPT keeps the
 

173
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,550
this one. This way, GPT keeps the
context from our analyzes and gives us

174
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
context from our analyzes and gives us
 

175
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,110
context from our analyzes and gives us
ready to use ideas, image prompts, and

176
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
ready to use ideas, image prompts, and
 

177
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,270
ready to use ideas, image prompts, and
video prompts. All right, so now we got

178
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
video prompts. All right, so now we got
 

179
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,750
video prompts. All right, so now we got
our custom avatar. This is Kayla. She's

180
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
our custom avatar. This is Kayla. She's
 

181
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,070
our custom avatar. This is Kayla. She's
24. We got a little backstory right

182
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
24. We got a little backstory right
 

183
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,030
24. We got a little backstory right
here, but we also got the ad scripts. So

184
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
here, but we also got the ad scripts. So
 

185
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,509
here, but we also got the ad scripts. So
you can see the scenes. So here's the

186
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
you can see the scenes. So here's the
 

187
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,670
you can see the scenes. So here's the
hook, the problem, the solution. And

188
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
hook, the problem, the solution. And
 

189
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,110
hook, the problem, the solution. And
once you scroll down, we can see the

190
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
once you scroll down, we can see the
 

191
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,390
once you scroll down, we can see the
breakdown with the prompts. So here we

192
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
breakdown with the prompts. So here we
 

193
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,190
breakdown with the prompts. So here we
got the script. Then we got the nano

194
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
got the script. Then we got the nano
 

195
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,350
got the script. Then we got the nano
banana prompt. So this will be our image

196
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
banana prompt. So this will be our image
 

197
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,430
banana prompt. So this will be our image
prompt. Here we got all of the scenes,

198
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
prompt. Here we got all of the scenes,
 

199
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,430
prompt. Here we got all of the scenes,
all of the scripts, and all of the

200
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,440
all of the scripts, and all of the
 

201
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,270
all of the scripts, and all of the
prompts that we need to start creating

202
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
prompts that we need to start creating
 

203
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,670
prompts that we need to start creating
these ads. The cool thing is that you

204
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
these ads. The cool thing is that you
 

205
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,990
these ads. The cool thing is that you
can play around here. You can ask chatbt

206
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
can play around here. You can ask chatbt
 

207
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,750
can play around here. You can ask chatbt
to create more variants. If you didn't

208
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
to create more variants. If you didn't
 

209
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,830
to create more variants. If you didn't
like the first one, you can ask it to

210
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
like the first one, you can ask it to
 

211
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,390
like the first one, you can ask it to
create like five variants, 10 variants,

212
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
create like five variants, 10 variants,
 

213
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,030
create like five variants, 10 variants,
as many as you like and then make more

214
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
as many as you like and then make more
 

215
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,589
as many as you like and then make more
hooks or alternative prompts. And then

216
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
hooks or alternative prompts. And then
 

217
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,390
hooks or alternative prompts. And then
you pick a script that you like in order

218
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
you pick a script that you like in order
 

219
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,189
you pick a script that you like in order
to create the ads that you want. So, for

220
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
to create the ads that you want. So, for
 

221
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,189
to create the ads that you want. So, for
now, I'll just stick with this version.

222
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
now, I'll just stick with this version.
 

223
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,270
now, I'll just stick with this version.
The key is to get the foundation right

224
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
The key is to get the foundation right
 

225
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,110
The key is to get the foundation right
because when your first scenes are

226
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
because when your first scenes are
 

227
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,950
because when your first scenes are
solid, then the rest of the process goes

228
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
solid, then the rest of the process goes
 

229
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,629
solid, then the rest of the process goes
a lot smoother. Let's head over to

230
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
a lot smoother. Let's head over to
 

231
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,110
a lot smoother. Let's head over to
Google AI Studio so we can start to

232
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
Google AI Studio so we can start to
 

233
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,749
Google AI Studio so we can start to
create our images. So just go open

234
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
create our images. So just go open
 

235
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,230
create our images. So just go open
Google AI studio. Inside here you will

236
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
Google AI studio. Inside here you will
 

237
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,390
Google AI studio. Inside here you will
find nano banana. So click on this one.

238
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
find nano banana. So click on this one.
 

239
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,150
find nano banana. So click on this one.
So the first thing we will try is to

240
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
So the first thing we will try is to
 

241
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,909
So the first thing we will try is to
create the avatar from the prompts that

242
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
create the avatar from the prompts that
 

243
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,310
create the avatar from the prompts that
we already generated. I'll run one of

244
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
we already generated. I'll run one of
 

245
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,710
we already generated. I'll run one of
those so you can see how it works. So

246
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
those so you can see how it works. So
 

247
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,950
those so you can see how it works. So
just go to your chat GBT and find the

248
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
just go to your chat GBT and find the
 

249
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,469
just go to your chat GBT and find the
nano banana prompt. So let's go for the

250
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
nano banana prompt. So let's go for the
 

251
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,950
nano banana prompt. So let's go for the
first scene and just copy this one and

252
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
first scene and just copy this one and
 

253
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,350
first scene and just copy this one and
then we'll paste that in. So, as you can

254
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
then we'll paste that in. So, as you can
 

255
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,189
then we'll paste that in. So, as you can
see, this is okay, but it seems very AI.

256
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
see, this is okay, but it seems very AI.
 

257
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,430
see, this is okay, but it seems very AI.
So, I will actually show you a useful

258
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
So, I will actually show you a useful
 

259
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,870
So, I will actually show you a useful
trick so that you can find a image

260
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
trick so that you can find a image
 

261
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,029
trick so that you can find a image
online and use that as your reference

262
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
online and use that as your reference
 

263
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,510
online and use that as your reference
image. It helps AI match the style and

264
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
image. It helps AI match the style and
 

265
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,350
image. It helps AI match the style and
the wibe you're going for. What I'll do

266
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
the wibe you're going for. What I'll do
 

267
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,990
the wibe you're going for. What I'll do
is I'll just go to Hen because I know

268
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
is I'll just go to Hen because I know
 

269
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,749
is I'll just go to Hen because I know
they already have a lot of AI avatars.

270
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
they already have a lot of AI avatars.
 

271
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,230
they already have a lot of AI avatars.
So, you can use any image if you want,

272
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
So, you can use any image if you want,
 

273
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,550
So, you can use any image if you want,
but I'll use one here. You just click on

274
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
but I'll use one here. You just click on
 

275
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,230
but I'll use one here. You just click on
create a video. Click on the one in

276
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
create a video. Click on the one in
 

277
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,909
create a video. Click on the one in
portrait because that's the one we're

278
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
portrait because that's the one we're
 

279
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,990
portrait because that's the one we're
creating and then you go to the avatar

280
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
creating and then you go to the avatar
 

281
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,230
creating and then you go to the avatar
in the top corner right here and then

282
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
in the top corner right here and then
 

283
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,870
in the top corner right here and then
you click on replace avatar and they

284
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
you click on replace avatar and they
 

285
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,350
you click on replace avatar and they
actually got this UGC section. So click

286
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
actually got this UGC section. So click
 

287
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,830
actually got this UGC section. So click
on UGC and then you find the one you

288
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
on UGC and then you find the one you
 

289
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,390
on UGC and then you find the one you
like. I think this one could work well.

290
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
like. I think this one could work well.
 

291
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,550
like. I think this one could work well.
So what we do is we just right click and

292
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
So what we do is we just right click and
 

293
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,110
So what we do is we just right click and
then we save that image. Once we have

294
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
then we save that image. Once we have
 

295
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,390
then we save that image. Once we have
the image, we can go back into Google AI

296
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
the image, we can go back into Google AI
 

297
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,189
the image, we can go back into Google AI
Studio and we can just add that in and

298
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
Studio and we can just add that in and
 

299
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,950
Studio and we can just add that in and
say, "Please change the hairstyle

300
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
say, "Please change the hairstyle
 

301
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,230
say, "Please change the hairstyle
and her outfit, but keep the same

302
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
and her outfit, but keep the same
 

303
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,710
and her outfit, but keep the same
quality." Let's run that one. Now, as

304
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
quality." Let's run that one. Now, as
 

305
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,510
quality." Let's run that one. Now, as
you can see, we generated a new image

306
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
you can see, we generated a new image
 

307
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,909
you can see, we generated a new image
from this image that we already liked

308
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
from this image that we already liked
 

309
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,029
from this image that we already liked
because we asked it specifically to have

310
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
because we asked it specifically to have
 

311
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,150
because we asked it specifically to have
the same quality. Now, this isn't as

312
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
the same quality. Now, this isn't as

that we want to create. Starting with
 

327
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,990
that we want to create. Starting with
the first prompt, we can see that we

328
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
the first prompt, we can see that we
 

329
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,309
the first prompt, we can see that we
have a girl in the gym holding our

330
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
have a girl in the gym holding our
 

331
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,070
have a girl in the gym holding our
product. This tells us that we need to

332
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
product. This tells us that we need to
 

333
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,550
product. This tells us that we need to
combine both elements, the girl and the

334
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
combine both elements, the girl and the
 

335
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,189
combine both elements, the girl and the

336
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
product. We'll copy this prompt and
 

337
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,230
product. We'll copy this prompt and
we'll go to Google AI Studio and we'll

338
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
we'll go to Google AI Studio and we'll
 

339
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,790
we'll go to Google AI Studio and we'll
add in our reference image and we'll

340
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
add in our reference image and we'll
 

341
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,749
add in our reference image and we'll
also add in our product. Once you add

342
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
also add in our product. Once you add
 

343
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,590
also add in our product. Once you add
the product, make sure that it's in the

344
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
the product, make sure that it's in the
 

345
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,830
the product, make sure that it's in the
same format so that Google doesn't get

346
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
same format so that Google doesn't get
 

347
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,110
same format so that Google doesn't get
confused. Now we can just tell Google

348
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
confused. Now we can just tell Google
 

349
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,510
confused. Now we can just tell Google
make her hold this product in a natural

350
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
make her hold this product in a natural
 

351
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,670
make her hold this product in a natural
way. Then we run that. Now we can see

352
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
way. Then we run that. Now we can see
 

353
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,070
way. Then we run that. Now we can see
that we have our reference image holding

354
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
that we have our reference image holding
 

355
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,110
that we have our reference image holding
our product. Now our prompt was young

356
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
our product. Now our prompt was young
 

357
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,550
our product. Now our prompt was young
athletic woman. I'll say put her in the

358
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
athletic woman. I'll say put her in the
 

359
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,390
athletic woman. I'll say put her in the
gym wearing gym clothes holding this

360
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
gym wearing gym clothes holding this
 

361
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,390
gym wearing gym clothes holding this
black smart tumbler towards the camera.

362
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
black smart tumbler towards the camera.
 

363
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,469
black smart tumbler towards the camera.
And I'll also add keep the quality the

364
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
And I'll also add keep the quality the
 

365
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,629
And I'll also add keep the quality the
same. Now, let's see how that looks.

366
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
same. Now, let's see how that looks.
 

367
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,510
same. Now, let's see how that looks.
We'll keep iterating until we get the

368
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
We'll keep iterating until we get the
 

369
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,350
We'll keep iterating until we get the
product that we want. This looks pretty

370
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
product that we want. This looks pretty
 

371
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,189
product that we want. This looks pretty
nice, but I don't like that she's

372
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
nice, but I don't like that she's
 

373
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,909
nice, but I don't like that she's
holding it with two hands. So, I'll just

374
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
holding it with two hands. So, I'll just
 

375
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,270
holding it with two hands. So, I'll just
download this again and tell it make her

376
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
download this again and tell it make her
 

377
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,510
download this again and tell it make her
hold the product with one hand. Let's

378
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
hold the product with one hand. Let's
 

379
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,430
hold the product with one hand. Let's
see how that turns out. Great. This

380
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
see how that turns out. Great. This
 

381
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,350
see how that turns out. Great. This
looks nice. Now, she's holding it in a

382
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
looks nice. Now, she's holding it in a
 

383
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,110
looks nice. Now, she's holding it in a
natural way and everything is looking

384
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
natural way and everything is looking
 

385
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,510
natural way and everything is looking
great. So, what we'll do is we'll

386
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
great. So, what we'll do is we'll
 

387
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,350
great. So, what we'll do is we'll
download this and from there it's just

388
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
download this and from there it's just
 

389
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,110
download this and from there it's just
repeating the process for all of the

390
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
repeating the process for all of the
 

391
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,350
repeating the process for all of the
five scenes. The key is to tune the

392
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
five scenes. The key is to tune the
 

393
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,830
five scenes. The key is to tune the
prompts until the images fits the scenes

394
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
prompts until the images fits the scenes
 

395
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,390
prompts until the images fits the scenes
that you want for the ads. So, I'll just

396
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
that you want for the ads. So, I'll just
 

397
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,350
that you want for the ads. So, I'll just
keep going finding the next scene. And

398
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
keep going finding the next scene. And
 

399
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,430
keep going finding the next scene. And
once we got all of that figured out,

400
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
once we got all of that figured out,
 

401
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,350
once we got all of that figured out,
we'll download them. Now that we got all

402
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
we'll download them. Now that we got all
 

403
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,430
we'll download them. Now that we got all
of our scenes downloaded, the next step

404
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
of our scenes downloaded, the next step
 

405
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,309
of our scenes downloaded, the next step
is to prep them for V3. We want to make

406
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
is to prep them for V3. We want to make
 

407
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,869
is to prep them for V3. We want to make
sure that V3 generates the videos in

408
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
sure that V3 generates the videos in
 

409
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,110
sure that V3 generates the videos in
portrait format. To keep it simple,

410
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
portrait format. To keep it simple,
 

411
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,869
portrait format. To keep it simple,
we're going to pre-frame the images

412
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
we're going to pre-frame the images
 

413
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,430
we're going to pre-frame the images
inside of Canva. This step is crucial

Click on frames to video so that we can
 

451
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,350
Click on frames to video so that we can
use the scenes and images we just

452
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
use the scenes and images we just
 

453
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,269
use the scenes and images we just
created in order to make the AI

454

created in order to make the AI
 

455
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,590
created in order to make the AI
understand what we're trying to create.

456
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
understand what we're trying to create.
 

457
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,350
understand what we're trying to create.
Make sure you have the frames to video

458
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
Make sure you have the frames to video
 

459
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,070
Make sure you have the frames to video
on. And then make sure you also have the

461
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,470
on. And then make sure you also have the
settings set to V3 fast. We don't want

462
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
settings set to V3 fast. We don't want
 

463
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,550
settings set to V3 fast. We don't want
to waste any credits by using the

464
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
to waste any credits by using the
 

465
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,870
to waste any credits by using the
quality one. It isn't that much better

466
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
quality one. It isn't that much better
 

467
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,070
quality one. It isn't that much better

477
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,110
GBT and grab the V3 prompt to put in
here. So go to V3. This will be the

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
here. So go to V3. This will be the
 

479
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,750
here. So go to V3. This will be the
first scene. Just paste that in. Make

480
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
first scene. Just paste that in. Make
 

481
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,750
first scene. Just paste that in. Make
your adjustments to the script. It isn't

perfect, but with a small adjustments,
 

485

perfect, but with a small adjustments,
you can make it perfect. I'll just edit

you can make it perfect. I'll just edit
 

487
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,949
you can make it perfect. I'll just edit
this first one to say use the image as

this first one to say use the image as
 

489

this first one to say use the image as

create videos in portrait, we need to

492
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
create videos in portrait, we need to

make sure that it understands what we're
 

495
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,509
make sure that it understands what we're
trying to do. So, what I like to do is

496
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
trying to do. So, what I like to do is
 

497

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
blue on the sides as it is. Now, let's
 

501
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,230
blue on the sides as it is. Now, let's
just run this prompt. At this stage,

502
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
just run this prompt. At this stage,
 

503
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,389
just run this prompt. At this stage,
it's really about testing. You try out

504
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
it's really about testing. You try out
 

505
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,190
it's really about testing. You try out
your images with different scenes and

506
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
your images with different scenes and
 

507
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,269
your images with different scenes and
different prompts to see what works.

508
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
different prompts to see what works.

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,670
Some videos just won't turn out right,
and that's okay. I just started to

and that's okay. I just started to
 

513
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,750
and that's okay. I just started to
generate all of the scenes. I'll show

generate all of the scenes. I'll show

there's something off with her eyes and
 

527
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,870
there's something off with her eyes and
she's talking very slowly. So that's why

528
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
she's talking very slowly. So that's why
 

529
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,030
she's talking very slowly. So that's why
you need to really play around and do a

you need to really play around and do a

you need to really play around and do a
lot of generations. I basically swapped

lot of generations. I basically swapped
 

533
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,190

out the image because I didn't like that
 

535
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,509
out the image because I didn't like that
one and this one really turns out a lot

00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
one and this one really turns out a lot
 

537
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,310
one and this one really turns out a lot
better.
