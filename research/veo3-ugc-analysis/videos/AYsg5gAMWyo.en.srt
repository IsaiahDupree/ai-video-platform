3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,870
VO3.1 Nano Banana Sora 2. There are all
of these amazing models dropping. So, I

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
of these amazing models dropping. So, I
 

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,309
of these amazing models dropping. So, I
figured why not just build a system

6
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
figured why not just build a system
 

7
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,150
figured why not just build a system
where we can use all of them. So, what

8
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
where we can use all of them. So, what
 

9
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,110
where we can use all of them. So, what
we're going to be looking at today is

10
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
we're going to be looking at today is
 

11
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,509
we're going to be looking at today is
the ultimate UGC ads system where all

12
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
the ultimate UGC ads system where all
 

13
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,950

that product, and a setting of the
 

21
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,750
that product, and a setting of the
video. And then all you have to do is

22
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
video. And then all you have to do is
 

23
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,029

So, the question that we're going to be

42
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
So, the question that we're going to be
 

43
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,270
So, the question that we're going to be
trying to answer today is which one is

44
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
trying to answer today is which one is
 

45
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,350
trying to answer today is which one is
best for UGC ads. So, taking a look at

46
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
best for UGC ads. So, taking a look at
 

47
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,470
best for UGC ads. So, taking a look at
this workflow, you can see that there's

48
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
this workflow, you can see that there's
 

49
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,630
this workflow, you can see that there's
basically three paths. There's the VO3.1

50
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
basically three paths. There's the VO3.1
 

51
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,510
basically three paths. There's the VO3.1
path, the Nano Banana Plus V3.1 path,

52
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
path, the Nano Banana Plus V3.1 path,
 

53
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,270
path, the Nano Banana Plus V3.1 path,
and then the Sora 2 path. So, we're

54
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
and then the Sora 2 path. So, we're
 

55
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,549
and then the Sora 2 path. So, we're
going to jump into a live demo. We're

56
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
going to jump into a live demo. We're
 

57
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,750
going to jump into a live demo. We're
going to run all three of these paths,

58
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
going to run all three of these paths,
 

59
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,790
going to run all three of these paths,
and I'm going to explain what every

74
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
before we go ahead and run the live
 

75
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,789
before we go ahead and run the live
example, let's look at a few of our

76
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799

outputs that we've already gotten with
 

79
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,070
outputs that we've already gotten with
this exact system. So, the first product

80
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
this exact system. So, the first product
 

81
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,149

love how this gives instant glossy shine
without any greasiness. It dries fast

160
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
without any greasiness. It dries fast
 

161
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,830
without any greasiness. It dries fast
and feels weightless. I love how this

162
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
and feels weightless. I love how this
 

163
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,070
and feels weightless. I love how this
adds instant gloss without feeling

164
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
adds instant gloss without feeling
 

165
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,949
adds instant gloss without feeling
greasy. It dries so fast and leaves no

166
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
greasy. It dries so fast and leaves no
 

167
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,990
greasy. It dries so fast and leaves no
sticky buildup.

168
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
sticky buildup.
 

169
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,430
sticky buildup.
>> All right, so we've seen a few examples.

170
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
>> All right, so we've seen a few examples.
 

171
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,630
>> All right, so we've seen a few examples.
We'll come back at the end and compare

172
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
We'll come back at the end and compare
 

173
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,150
We'll come back at the end and compare
more outputs and see which one we

174
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
more outputs and see which one we
 

175
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,150
more outputs and see which one we
ultimately deem being the king of these

176
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
ultimately deem being the king of these
 

177
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,910
ultimately deem being the king of these
models. But let's go ahead and do a live

178
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
models. But let's go ahead and do a live
 

179
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,509
models. But let's go ahead and do a live
example. So the first two that we did

180
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
example. So the first two that we did
 

181
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,430
example. So the first two that we did
were AI generated images. This first one

182
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
were AI generated images. This first one
 

183
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,110
were AI generated images. This first one
was creatine gummies, as you can see,

184
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
was creatine gummies, as you can see,
 

185
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,509
was creatine gummies, as you can see,
and the second one was our hairspray,

186
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
and the second one was our hairspray,
 

187
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,110
and the second one was our hairspray,
which looked like this. So, what we're

188
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
which looked like this. So, what we're
 

189
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,550
which looked like this. So, what we're
going to do for the third example is a

190
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
going to do for the third example is a
 

191
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,229
going to do for the third example is a
real product image, and this is actually

192
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
real product image, and this is actually
 

193
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,070
real product image, and this is actually
from an Amazon listing. So, it is a

194
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
from an Amazon listing. So, it is a
 

195
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,390
from an Amazon listing. So, it is a
portable neck fan like this. We have the

196
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
portable neck fan like this. We have the
 

197
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,790
portable neck fan like this. We have the
ICP of middle-aged adults who spend long

198
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
ICP of middle-aged adults who spend long
 

199
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,470
ICP of middle-aged adults who spend long
hours outdoors or landscapers,

200
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
hours outdoors or landscapers,
 

201
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,070
hours outdoors or landscapers,

tending her garden in the afternoon sun.
So, hopefully you guys can see the value

216
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
So, hopefully you guys can see the value
 

217
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,550
So, hopefully you guys can see the value
prop here. it'd be really easy to just

218
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
prop here. it'd be really easy to just
 

219
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,149
prop here. it'd be really easy to just
throw in your product information right

220
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
throw in your product information right
 

221
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,830
throw in your product information right
here and then have this thing every day

222
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
here and then have this thing every day
 

223
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,710
here and then have this thing every day
create tons of UGC ad content for you.

224
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
create tons of UGC ad content for you.
 

225
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,550
create tons of UGC ad content for you.
Then what happens in the workflow is it

226
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
Then what happens in the workflow is it
 

227
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,149
Then what happens in the workflow is it
takes that and we have different AI

228
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
takes that and we have different AI
 

229
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,910
takes that and we have different AI
agents here that are trained to prompt

230
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
agents here that are trained to prompt
 

231
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,509
agents here that are trained to prompt
in different ways and that's how we're

232
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
in different ways and that's how we're
 

233
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,830
in different ways and that's how we're
optimizing you know the features and ICP

234
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
optimizing you know the features and ICP
 

235
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,070
optimizing you know the features and ICP
and the setting to actually go into this

236
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
and the setting to actually go into this
 

237
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,750
and the setting to actually go into this
UGC content. So I'm going to go ahead

238
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
UGC content. So I'm going to go ahead
 

239
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,350
UGC content. So I'm going to go ahead
and hit execute workflow. It's going to

240
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
and hit execute workflow. It's going to
 

241
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,949
and hit execute workflow. It's going to
pull in that data from the sheet. It's

242
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
pull in that data from the sheet. It's
 

243
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,789
pull in that data from the sheet. It's
going to do one row first and the first

244
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
going to do one row first and the first
 

245
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,550
going to do one row first and the first
row that it's doing is nano Banana plus

246
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
row that it's doing is nano Banana plus
 

247
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,110
row that it's doing is nano Banana plus
V3.1 because as you can see right here

248
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
V3.1 because as you can see right here
 

249
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,869
V3.1 because as you can see right here
it's basically processing this row and

250
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
it's basically processing this row and
 

251
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,869
it's basically processing this row and
that's the model that we chose was

252
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
that's the model that we chose was
 

253
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,350
that's the model that we chose was
NanoBanana plus V3.1. So I'm actually

254
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
NanoBanana plus V3.1. So I'm actually
 

255
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,789
NanoBanana plus V3.1. So I'm actually
just going to start to explain what's

256
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
just going to start to explain what's
 

257
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,350
just going to start to explain what's
going on here as this is running. So you

258
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
going on here as this is running. So you
 

259
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,949
going on here as this is running. So you
can see here we're pulling in data from

260
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
can see here we're pulling in data from
 

261
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,390
can see here we're pulling in data from
this sheet, right? The only thing

262
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
this sheet, right? The only thing
 

263
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,750
this sheet, right? The only thing
special going on here is we're making

264
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
special going on here is we're making
 

265
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,990
special going on here is we're making
sure that the status column equals ready

266
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
sure that the status column equals ready
 

267
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,429
sure that the status column equals ready
because we don't want to pull in all of

268
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
because we don't want to pull in all of
 

269
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,550
because we don't want to pull in all of
these rows that have already been

270
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
these rows that have already been
 

271
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,070
these rows that have already been
finished. And then we also turned on

272
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
finished. And then we also turned on
 

273
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,830
finished. And then we also turned on
this option that says return only the

274
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
this option that says return only the
 

275
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,509
this option that says return only the
first matching row because we don't want

276
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
first matching row because we don't want
 

277
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,509
first matching row because we don't want
to do, you know, all six of these at a

278
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
to do, you know, all six of these at a
 

279
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,429
to do, you know, all six of these at a
time. We want to just do one by one. You

280
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
time. We want to just do one by one. You
 

281
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,470
time. We want to just do one by one. You
could obviously change that if you want,

282
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
could obviously change that if you want,
 

283
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,910
could obviously change that if you want,
but that's the way we're rocking right

284
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
but that's the way we're rocking right
 

285
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,589
but that's the way we're rocking right
now. Anyways, we then go into this

286
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
now. Anyways, we then go into this
 

287
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,589
now. Anyways, we then go into this
switch node and what happens here is it

288
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
switch node and what happens here is it
 

289
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,670
switch node and what happens here is it
basically just checks what the model was

290
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
basically just checks what the model was
 

291
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,469
basically just checks what the model was
selected as. So if it was V3.1, it goes

292
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
selected as. So if it was V3.1, it goes
 

293
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,430
selected as. So if it was V3.1, it goes
up. If it was nano plus V3.1, it goes to

294
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
up. If it was nano plus V3.1, it goes to
 

295
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,270
up. If it was nano plus V3.1, it goes to
the middle. And if it was SOAR 2, it

296
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
the middle. And if it was SOAR 2, it
 

297
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,790
the middle. And if it was SOAR 2, it
goes down. As you can see, these three

298
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
goes down. As you can see, these three
 

299
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,830
goes down. As you can see, these three
paths. So, this one was obviously V3.1

300
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
paths. So, this one was obviously V3.1
 

301
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,670
paths. So, this one was obviously V3.1
plus nanobanana, which is why it went

302
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
plus nanobanana, which is why it went
 

303
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,350
plus nanobanana, which is why it went
here. And that's why we're doing this

304
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
here. And that's why we're doing this
 

305
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,510
here. And that's why we're doing this
first step, which is an image prompt.

306
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
first step, which is an image prompt.
 

307
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,510
first step, which is an image prompt.
So, let me explain why I'm doing this.

308
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
So, let me explain why I'm doing this.
 

309
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,270
So, let me explain why I'm doing this.
What we're starting with is a picture of

310
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
What we're starting with is a picture of
 

311
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,870
What we're starting with is a picture of
our product because we need to make sure

312
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
our product because we need to make sure
 

313
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,350
our product because we need to make sure
that the product image looks actually

314
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
that the product image looks actually
 

315
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,189
that the product image looks actually
good in our final copy. Otherwise, we're

316
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
good in our final copy. Otherwise, we're
 

317
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,230
good in our final copy. Otherwise, we're
not going to be able to sell any of

318
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
not going to be able to sell any of
 

319
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,310
not going to be able to sell any of
that. So, in my mind, the most ideal way

320
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
that. So, in my mind, the most ideal way
 

321
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,230
that. So, in my mind, the most ideal way
to do this is to take that product image

322
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
to do this is to take that product image
 

323
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,749
to do this is to take that product image
that we're given. So, if we just want to

324
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
that we're given. So, if we just want to
 

325
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,830
that we're given. So, if we just want to
get a quick refresher, taking this

326
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
get a quick refresher, taking this
 

327
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,629
get a quick refresher, taking this
product image right here and using AI to

328
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
product image right here and using AI to
 

329
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,550
product image right here and using AI to
turn this into an image where someone is

330
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
turn this into an image where someone is
 

331
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,189
turn this into an image where someone is
wearing it or holding it and then we can

332
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
wearing it or holding it and then we can
 

333
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,110
wearing it or holding it and then we can
take that optimized image and turn that

334
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
take that optimized image and turn that
 

335
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,270
take that optimized image and turn that
into a video. And so, ideally, I would

336
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
into a video. And so, ideally, I would
 

337
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,590
into a video. And so, ideally, I would
do this also for Sora. But when you send

338
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
do this also for Sora. But when you send
 

339
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,230
do this also for Sora. But when you send
a image to Sora, if it looks like a

340
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
a image to Sora, if it looks like a
 

341
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,469
a image to Sora, if it looks like a
realistic human person, even if it's an

342
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
realistic human person, even if it's an
 

343
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,550
realistic human person, even if it's an
AI generated human, it's going to reject

344
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
AI generated human, it's going to reject
 

345
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,909
AI generated human, it's going to reject
it. Google VO3.1 however does not reject

346
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
it. Google VO3.1 however does not reject
 

347
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,189
it. Google VO3.1 however does not reject
it which is why we have this little

348
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
it which is why we have this little
 

349
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,670
it which is why we have this little
extra bonus method here. Now the

350
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
extra bonus method here. Now the
 

351
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,749
extra bonus method here. Now the
workaround here is if you do Sora 2 you

352
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
workaround here is if you do Sora 2 you
 

353
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,350
workaround here is if you do Sora 2 you
can use cameos. So if you haven't seen

354
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
can use cameos. So if you haven't seen
 

355
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,590
can use cameos. So if you haven't seen
that before then I'll drop my video I

356
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
that before then I'll drop my video I
 

357
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,270
that before then I'll drop my video I
made with Nitn and Sora 2. I'll tag it

358
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
made with Nitn and Sora 2. I'll tag it
 

359
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,710
made with Nitn and Sora 2. I'll tag it
right up here and you can see you could

360
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
right up here and you can see you could
 

361
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,150
right up here and you can see you could
use cameos. So you could create one of

362
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
use cameos. So you could create one of
 

363
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,909
use cameos. So you could create one of
yourself or you could use some other

364
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
yourself or you could use some other
 

365
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,830
yourself or you could use some other
person and have them being in your

366
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
person and have them being in your
 

367
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,310
person and have them being in your
content with your product something like

368
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
content with your product something like
 

369
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,230
content with your product something like
that. So anyways we're using Nano Banana

370
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
that. So anyways we're using Nano Banana
 

371
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,150
that. So anyways we're using Nano Banana
to create an image of the product being

372
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
to create an image of the product being
 

373
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,310
to create an image of the product being
held or worn by a person. And then we

374
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
held or worn by a person. And then we
 

375
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,909
held or worn by a person. And then we
take that image and we turn it into a

376
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
take that image and we turn it into a
 

377
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,150
take that image and we turn it into a
video with VO3.1. So anyways, you can

378
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
video with VO3.1. So anyways, you can
 

379
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,510
video with VO3.1. So anyways, you can
see that that actually just finished up.

380
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
see that that actually just finished up.
 

381
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,029
see that that actually just finished up.
So that's telling me I need to speed up

382
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
So that's telling me I need to speed up
 

383
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,110
So that's telling me I need to speed up
a little bit. Let's click into this AI

384
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
a little bit. Let's click into this AI

agent to understand how it is making an
 

387
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,950
agent to understand how it is making an
image prompt. We're giving it two

388
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
image prompt. We're giving it two
 

389
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,710
image prompt. We're giving it two
things. We're giving it the product,

390
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
things. We're giving it the product,
 

391
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,550
things. We're giving it the product,
which as you can see, if I open this up,

392
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
which as you can see, if I open this up,
 

393
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,990
which as you can see, if I open this up,
it's coming through as portable neck

394
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
it's coming through as portable neck
 

395
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,670
it's coming through as portable neck
fan, and we're giving it the image

396
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
fan, and we're giving it the image
 

397
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,870
fan, and we're giving it the image
setting, which is actually just the

398
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
setting, which is actually just the
 

399
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,710
setting, which is actually just the
video setting, but it says, "A friendly

00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
middle-aged woman is tending her garden
 

403
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,469
middle-aged woman is tending her garden
under the sun. She pauses, smiles at the

404
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
under the sun. She pauses, smiles at the
 

405
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,830
under the sun. She pauses, smiles at the
camera, and gestures toward the sleek

408
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
fan resting around her neck." So the AI
 

409
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,590
fan resting around her neck." So the AI
agent takes that information and then it

410
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
agent takes that information and then it
 

411
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,029
agent takes that information and then it
reads through its system prompt to

412
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
reads through its system prompt to
 

413
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,390
reads through its system prompt to
understand what do I need to do with

414
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
understand what do I need to do with
 

415
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,550
understand what do I need to do with
that information. I'm not going to read

416
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
that information. I'm not going to read
 

417
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,309
that information. I'm not going to read
this entire system prompt, but you guys

418
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
this entire system prompt, but you guys
 

419
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,670
this entire system prompt, but you guys
will be able to once again download this

420
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
will be able to once again download this
 

421
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,350
will be able to once again download this
template for free and you can dive into

this and understand why I have it set up
 

425
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,550
this and understand why I have it set up
this way. One thing I did want to

426
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
this way. One thing I did want to
 

427
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,150
this way. One thing I did want to
preface though is I made this workflow

428
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
preface though is I made this workflow
 

429
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,830
preface though is I made this workflow
to be a template. So these system

430
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
to be a template. So these system
 

431
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,830
to be a template. So these system
prompts are not perfect or optimized and

432
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
prompts are not perfect or optimized and
 

433
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,110
prompts are not perfect or optimized and
it would really be on you to get in here

it would really be on you to get in here
and customize them a little bit for your

436
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
and customize them a little bit for your
 

437
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,309
and customize them a little bit for your
use case, but it gives us a great place

438
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
use case, but it gives us a great place
 

439
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,710
use case, but it gives us a great place
to start. So anyways, you are an expert

environment. We talk about authentic
 

471
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,110
environment. We talk about authentic
details, technical style. And then

472
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
details, technical style. And then
 

473
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,950
details, technical style. And then
finally, some critical instruction like

474
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
finally, some critical instruction like
 

475
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,189
finally, some critical instruction like
only outputting the image prompt, not an

476
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
only outputting the image prompt, not an
 

477
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,510
only outputting the image prompt, not an
actual image or you know, hey, here's

478
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
actual image or you know, hey, here's
 

479
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,870
actual image or you know, hey, here's
your image prompt. You know, we just

480
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
your image prompt. You know, we just
 

481
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,550
your image prompt. You know, we just
want the prompt. So, out of that, what

482
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
want the prompt. So, out of that, what
 

483
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,629
want the prompt. So, out of that, what
we get is our image prompt. And you can

484
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
we get is our image prompt. And you can
 

485
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,070
we get is our image prompt. And you can
see it's pretty detailed. It has stuff

486
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
see it's pretty detailed. It has stuff
 

487
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,830
see it's pretty detailed. It has stuff
like lighting. It has stuff like camera

488
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
like lighting. It has stuff like camera
 

489
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,830
like lighting. It has stuff like camera
angle and composition and stuff like

490
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
angle and composition and stuff like
 

491
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,830
angle and composition and stuff like
that. And we're able to take that

492
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
that. And we're able to take that
 

493
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,990
that. And we're able to take that
output, feed it into the next node,

494
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
output, feed it into the next node,
 

495
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,029
output, feed it into the next node,
which is our HTTP request to a service

496
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
which is our HTTP request to a service
 

497
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,510
which is our HTTP request to a service
called Key AI, which lets us access tons

498
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
called Key AI, which lets us access tons
 

499
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,189
called Key AI, which lets us access tons
of different AI image and video

500
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
of different AI image and video
 

501
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,350
of different AI image and video
generation models. So this is key. As

502
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
generation models. So this is key. As
 

503
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,790
generation models. So this is key. As
you can see, we have tons of stuff like

504
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
you can see, we have tons of stuff like
 

505
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,550
you can see, we have tons of stuff like
VO3.1, Sora 2 Pro, 40 image, Flux

506
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
VO3.1, Sora 2 Pro, 40 image, Flux
 

507
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,790
VO3.1, Sora 2 Pro, 40 image, Flux
Context, Cling Turbo. It's kind of like

508
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
Context, Cling Turbo. It's kind of like
 

509
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,350
Context, Cling Turbo. It's kind of like
the open router for image and video

510
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
the open router for image and video
 

511
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,950
the open router for image and video
generation models. So, I'm not going to

512
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
generation models. So, I'm not going to
 

513
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,710
generation models. So, I'm not going to
deep dive into exactly how I set up this

514
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
deep dive into exactly how I set up this
 

515
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,230
deep dive into exactly how I set up this
API call, but definitely go and watch

516
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
API call, but definitely go and watch
 

517
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,990
API call, but definitely go and watch
that sore video if you haven't because I

518
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
that sore video if you haven't because I
 

519
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,430
that sore video if you haven't because I
actually go step by step and show you

520
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
actually go step by step and show you
 

521
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,350
actually go step by step and show you
guys how I did that. I'll also tag right

522
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
guys how I did that. I'll also tag right
 

523
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,350
guys how I did that. I'll also tag right
up here an API video that I made, which

524
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
up here an API video that I made, which
 

525
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,710
up here an API video that I made, which
you should watch anyways because it

526
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
you should watch anyways because it
 

527
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,469
you should watch anyways because it
really explains APIs and agents and

528
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
really explains APIs and agents and
 

529
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,909
really explains APIs and agents and
stuff like that. Anyways, essentially

530
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
stuff like that. Anyways, essentially
 

531
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,070
stuff like that. Anyways, essentially
what we're passing over here is our JSON

532
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
what we're passing over here is our JSON
 

533
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,830
what we're passing over here is our JSON
body, which is the most important part.

534
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
body, which is the most important part.
 

535
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,350
body, which is the most important part.
The model that we want to use is nano

536
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
The model that we want to use is nano
 

537
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,589
The model that we want to use is nano
bananait. We're sending over the input

538
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
bananait. We're sending over the input
 

539
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,430
bananait. We're sending over the input
prompt, which as you can see right here

540
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
prompt, which as you can see right here
 

541
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,029
prompt, which as you can see right here
is coming through. This is the output of

542
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
is coming through. This is the output of
 

543
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,629
is coming through. This is the output of
the image prompt agent that we just

544
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
the image prompt agent that we just
 

545
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,230
the image prompt agent that we just
looked at. Now, there is one thing I did

546
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
looked at. Now, there is one thing I did
 

547
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,749
looked at. Now, there is one thing I did
here that's kind of special is I

548
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
here that's kind of special is I
 

549
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,430
here that's kind of special is I
replaced new lines because you can see

550
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
replaced new lines because you can see
 

551
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,790
replaced new lines because you can see
if I get rid of this expression real

552
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
if I get rid of this expression real
 

553
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,309
if I get rid of this expression real
quick, what happens is we get these

554
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
quick, what happens is we get these
 

555
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,149
quick, what happens is we get these
little line breaks in here and we don't

556
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
little line breaks in here and we don't
 

557
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,509
little line breaks in here and we don't
want that because that will actually

558
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
want that because that will actually
 

559
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,990
want that because that will actually
break our request to key AI. So, that's

560
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
break our request to key AI. So, that's
 

561
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,990
break our request to key AI. So, that's
why I use that little expression. I also

562
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
why I use that little expression. I also
 

563
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
why I use that little expression. I also
talk about that in the Sora video. And

564
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
talk about that in the Sora video. And
 

565
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,190
talk about that in the Sora video. And
then we're giving it the image URL,

566
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
then we're giving it the image URL,
 

567
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,949
then we're giving it the image URL,
which is the one that came from our

568
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
which is the one that came from our
 

569
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,949
which is the one that came from our
Google sheet right here as you can see.

570
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
Google sheet right here as you can see.
 

571
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,150
Google sheet right here as you can see.
Finally, we're just saying we want this

572
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
Finally, we're just saying we want this
 

573
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,509
Finally, we're just saying we want this
to be vertical because a lot of times

574
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
to be vertical because a lot of times
 

575
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,670
to be vertical because a lot of times
the UGC content is kind of selfie style

576
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
the UGC content is kind of selfie style
 

577
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,190
the UGC content is kind of selfie style
and it's for like a Tik Tok or an

578
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
and it's for like a Tik Tok or an
 

579
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,790
and it's for like a Tik Tok or an
Instagram reel. So that's what we do

580
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
Instagram reel. So that's what we do
 

581
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,910
Instagram reel. So that's what we do
there. Once key gets this request, it

582
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
there. Once key gets this request, it
 

583
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,230
there. Once key gets this request, it
basically says to us, okay, cool. I got

584
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
basically says to us, okay, cool. I got
 

585
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,910
basically says to us, okay, cool. I got
all this information. We're working on

586
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
all this information. We're working on
 

587
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,590
all this information. We're working on
that right now. And so the next step

588
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
that right now. And so the next step
 

589
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,550
that right now. And so the next step
that we move into here is a wait node.

590
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
that we move into here is a wait node.
 

591
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,230
that we move into here is a wait node.
You can see that I have this set up for

592
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
You can see that I have this set up for
 

593
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,070
You can see that I have this set up for
5 seconds. So it goes ahead and it waits

594
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
5 seconds. So it goes ahead and it waits
 

595
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,990
5 seconds. So it goes ahead and it waits
for 5 seconds and then it checks in on

596
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
for 5 seconds and then it checks in on
 

597
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,389
for 5 seconds and then it checks in on
key and says, "Hey, do you have my order

598
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
key and says, "Hey, do you have my order
 

599
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,230
key and says, "Hey, do you have my order
done yet?" And we're able to get to that

600
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
done yet?" And we're able to get to that
 

601
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,310
done yet?" And we're able to get to that
by sending over the task ID of the

602
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
by sending over the task ID of the
 

603
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,910
by sending over the task ID of the
previous order. So it's like when you go

604
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
previous order. So it's like when you go
 

605
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,269
previous order. So it's like when you go
to a food truck and you order your food

606
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
to a food truck and you order your food
 

607
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,550
to a food truck and you order your food
and it says, "Okay, your order number

608
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
and it says, "Okay, your order number
 

609
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,550
and it says, "Okay, your order number
43." This is basically you walking back

610
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
43." This is basically you walking back
 

611
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,670
43." This is basically you walking back
up to the truck and saying, "Hey, I'm

612
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
up to the truck and saying, "Hey, I'm
 

613
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,430
up to the truck and saying, "Hey, I'm
order 43. Is it done?" And they'll

614
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
order 43. Is it done?" And they'll
 

615
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,670
order 43. Is it done?" And they'll
either say yes or no. And that's why we

616
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
either say yes or no. And that's why we
 

617
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,190
either say yes or no. And that's why we
use this little if node right here,

618
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
use this little if node right here,
 

619
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,190
use this little if node right here,
which is basically our yes or no check.

620
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
which is basically our yes or no check.
 

621
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,949
which is basically our yes or no check.
And we're looking to see if the state

622
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
And we're looking to see if the state
 

623
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,870
And we're looking to see if the state
equals success. Because if you look at

624
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
equals success. Because if you look at
 

625
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,710
equals success. Because if you look at
the first time we checked in, the state

626
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
the first time we checked in, the state
 

627
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,710
the first time we checked in, the state
equals waiting. The second time that we

628
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
equals waiting. The second time that we
 

629
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,630
equals waiting. The second time that we
checked in, the state equaled waiting.

630
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
checked in, the state equaled waiting.
 

631
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,070
checked in, the state equaled waiting.
And finally, the third time we checked

632
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
And finally, the third time we checked
 

633
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,910
And finally, the third time we checked
in, the state equals success, which

634
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
in, the state equals success, which
 

635
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,670
in, the state equals success, which
means that our order is ready. And so

636
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
means that our order is ready. And so
 

637
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,750
means that our order is ready. And so
notice that we have false branch or true

638
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
notice that we have false branch or true
 

639
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,990
notice that we have false branch or true
branch, and it's true when it's done. So

640
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
branch, and it's true when it's done. So
 

641
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,670
branch, and it's true when it's done. So
what we do is if it's false, we have

642
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
what we do is if it's false, we have
 

643
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,829
what we do is if it's false, we have
this line that goes back to the wait. So

644
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
this line that goes back to the wait. So
 

645
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,190
this line that goes back to the wait. So
this is why you can see it waited three

646
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
this is why you can see it waited three
 

647
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,710
this is why you can see it waited three
times, which means this took about 15

648
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
times, which means this took about 15
 

649
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,470
times, which means this took about 15
seconds to generate. And so the first

650
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
seconds to generate. And so the first
 

651
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,310
seconds to generate. And so the first
time it wasn't ready, it came back.

652
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
time it wasn't ready, it came back.
 

653
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,590
time it wasn't ready, it came back.
Second time it wasn't ready. We checked

654
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
Second time it wasn't ready. We checked
 

655
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,430
Second time it wasn't ready. We checked
in again. And then the third time after

656
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
in again. And then the third time after
 

657
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,430
in again. And then the third time after
it waited again, it was done. And so

658
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
it waited again, it was done. And so
 

659
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,269
it waited again, it was done. And so
when that's done, what we end up doing

660
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
when that's done, what we end up doing
 

661
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,030
when that's done, what we end up doing
is we want to real quick analyze that

662
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
is we want to real quick analyze that
 

663
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,670
is we want to real quick analyze that
image to see what is actually in there.

664
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
image to see what is actually in there.
 

665
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,030
image to see what is actually in there.
So here's the actual image that it

666
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
So here's the actual image that it
 

667
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,389
So here's the actual image that it
created for us, which looks awesome.

668
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
created for us, which looks awesome.
 

669
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,230
created for us, which looks awesome.
It's a green portable neck fan. She's in

670
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
It's a green portable neck fan. She's in
 

671
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,310
It's a green portable neck fan. She's in
her garden, and it even matches the

672
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
her garden, and it even matches the
 

673
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,590
her garden, and it even matches the
writing, as you can see. See, if we go

674
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
writing, as you can see. See, if we go
 

675
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,790
writing, as you can see. See, if we go
back to the source image, there's a

676
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
back to the source image, there's a
 

677
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,310
back to the source image, there's a
little bit of gold text right there.

678
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
little bit of gold text right there.
 

679
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,910
little bit of gold text right there.
There's these circles. So, that looks

680
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
There's these circles. So, that looks
 

681
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,509
There's these circles. So, that looks
really good. And so, I basically grabbed

682
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
really good. And so, I basically grabbed
 

683
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,949
really good. And so, I basically grabbed
this open AI note and said, "Describe

684
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
this open AI note and said, "Describe
 

685
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,150
this open AI note and said, "Describe
what's in the image. Describe the

686
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
what's in the image. Describe the
 

687
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,829
what's in the image. Describe the
environment." Stuff like that. And we

688
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
environment." Stuff like that. And we
 

689
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,269
environment." Stuff like that. And we
get back, the image features a woman

690
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
get back, the image features a woman
 

691
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,870
get back, the image features a woman
standing outdoors in what appears to be

692
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
standing outdoors in what appears to be
 

693
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,630
standing outdoors in what appears to be
a garden. The environment has raised

694
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
a garden. The environment has raised
 

695
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,230
a garden. The environment has raised
garden beds, blah blah blah. The woman

696
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
garden beds, blah blah blah. The woman
 

697
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,509
garden beds, blah blah blah. The woman
is wearing a light blue shirt. She has

698
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
is wearing a light blue shirt. She has
 

699
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,870
is wearing a light blue shirt. She has
her hair pulled back. Around her neck,

700
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
her hair pulled back. Around her neck,
 

701
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,230
her hair pulled back. Around her neck,
she has a green wearable device that

702
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
she has a green wearable device that
 

703
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,670
she has a green wearable device that
looks like a personal neck fan. Blah

704
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
looks like a personal neck fan. Blah
 

705
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,509
looks like a personal neck fan. Blah
blah blah. So, the reason why I wanted

706
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
blah blah. So, the reason why I wanted
 

707
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,350
blah blah. So, the reason why I wanted
to analyze the image real quick is

708
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
to analyze the image real quick is
 

709
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,430
to analyze the image real quick is
because the next step is to use another

710
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
because the next step is to use another
 

711
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,509
because the next step is to use another
AI agent to create a video prompt. And

712
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
AI agent to create a video prompt. And
 

713
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,030
AI agent to create a video prompt. And
in order to create a video prompt that

714
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
in order to create a video prompt that
 

715
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,110
in order to create a video prompt that
is consistent with our image, not only

716
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
is consistent with our image, not only
 

717
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,870
is consistent with our image, not only
are we going to give it that image, but

718
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
are we going to give it that image, but
 

719
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,710
are we going to give it that image, but
we also want to give it a quick analysis

720
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
we also want to give it a quick analysis
 

721
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,710
we also want to give it a quick analysis
of what is actually in that image so

722
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
of what is actually in that image so
 

723
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,389
of what is actually in that image so
that its prompt is consistent. And I

724
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
that its prompt is consistent. And I
 

725
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,430
that its prompt is consistent. And I
have tried doing this without the

726
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
have tried doing this without the
 

727
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,430
have tried doing this without the
analyze image step and it still works.

728
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
analyze image step and it still works.
 

729
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,710
analyze image step and it still works.
But doing this, it just seems to be

730
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
But doing this, it just seems to be
 

731
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,590
But doing this, it just seems to be
higher quality. So, anyways, we are

732
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
higher quality. So, anyways, we are
 

733
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,509
higher quality. So, anyways, we are
hitting another AI agent. This time

734
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
hitting another AI agent. This time
 

735
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,630
hitting another AI agent. This time
we're giving it a little bit more

736
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
we're giving it a little bit more
 

737
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,430
we're giving it a little bit more
information because keep in mind this

738
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
information because keep in mind this
 

739
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,350
information because keep in mind this
agent isn't just creating a video

740
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
agent isn't just creating a video
 

741
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,350
agent isn't just creating a video
prompt. It's also creating the dialogue

742
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
prompt. It's also creating the dialogue
 

743
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,269
prompt. It's also creating the dialogue
that the person in that video is going

744
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
that the person in that video is going
 

745
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,509
that the person in that video is going
to say. And so in order to do that, we

746
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
to say. And so in order to do that, we
 

747
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,110
to say. And so in order to do that, we
give it the product. We give it the

748
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
give it the product. We give it the
 

749
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,030
give it the product. We give it the
product ICP. We give it the product

750
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
product ICP. We give it the product
 

751
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,190
product ICP. We give it the product
features. We give the video setting. And

752
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
features. We give the video setting. And
 

753
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,550
features. We give the video setting. And
here's where we give it the reference

754
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
here's where we give it the reference
 

755
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,150
here's where we give it the reference
image description. So this is the

756
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
image description. So this is the
 

757
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,310
image description. So this is the
analysis of that image. So it looks at

758
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
analysis of that image. So it looks at
 

759
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,910
analysis of that image. So it looks at
all that information and it says, "Okay,

760
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
all that information and it says, "Okay,
 

761
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,509
all that information and it says, "Okay,
what do I do with that?" And so now we

762
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
what do I do with that?" And so now we
 

763
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,590
what do I do with that?" And so now we
have our system prompt. Once again, not

764
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
have our system prompt. Once again, not
 

765
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,790
have our system prompt. Once again, not
going to read the whole thing, but you

766
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
going to read the whole thing, but you
 

767
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,630
going to read the whole thing, but you
guys can have access to it for free. So,

768
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
guys can have access to it for free. So,
 

769
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,710
guys can have access to it for free. So,
we said that your role as an expert UGC

770
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
we said that your role as an expert UGC
 

771
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,470
we said that your role as an expert UGC
video creator. Your task is to generate

a prompt for an AI video model like

774
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
a prompt for an AI video model like
 

775
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,710
a prompt for an AI video model like
VO3.1. Your goal is to create a

appears to be filmed by an influencer
 

781
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,590
appears to be filmed by an influencer
using one hand to hold the phone and the

782
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
using one hand to hold the phone and the
 

783
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,350
using one hand to hold the phone and the
other to interact with the product. The

784

other to interact with the product. The
 

785

other to interact with the product. The
video needs to feel authentic, which is

786
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
video needs to feel authentic, which is
 

787
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,110
video needs to feel authentic, which is
why UGC ads are converting so well right

788
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
why UGC ads are converting so well right
 

789
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,350
why UGC ads are converting so well right
now because it's just real people

790
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
now because it's just real people
 

791
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,750
now because it's just real people
speaking real raw thoughts. Anyways, we

792
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
speaking real raw thoughts. Anyways, we
 

793
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,350
speaking real raw thoughts. Anyways, we
gave it some requirements like subject

794
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
gave it some requirements like subject
 

795
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,430
gave it some requirements like subject
and framing. We talk about the visual

796
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
and framing. We talk about the visual
 

797
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,150
and framing. We talk about the visual
style. We talk about tone and dialogue.

798
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
style. We talk about tone and dialogue.
 

799
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,150
style. We talk about tone and dialogue.
We give it some technical specs. We give

800
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
We give it some technical specs. We give
 

801
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,910
We give it some technical specs. We give
it some embedded elements in the prompt.

802
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
it some embedded elements in the prompt.
 

803
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,509
it some embedded elements in the prompt.
As you can see, we tell it that it's

804
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
As you can see, we tell it that it's
 

805
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,710
As you can see, we tell it that it's
going to get a reference image and it

806
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
going to get a reference image and it
 

807
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,550
going to get a reference image and it
needs to match that appearance and tone.

808
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
needs to match that appearance and tone.
 

809
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,030
needs to match that appearance and tone.
And then a real quick output prompt,

810
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
And then a real quick output prompt,
 

811
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,550
And then a real quick output prompt,
which is pretty concise. And honestly,

812
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
which is pretty concise. And honestly,
 

813
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,829
which is pretty concise. And honestly,
it looks like I might have accidentally

814
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
it looks like I might have accidentally
 

815
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,990
it looks like I might have accidentally
cut off the last sentence here, but

816
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
cut off the last sentence here, but
 

817
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,509
cut off the last sentence here, but
hopefully it still came out all right.

818
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
hopefully it still came out all right.
 

819
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,269
hopefully it still came out all right.
And so after that, we get this output.

820
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
And so after that, we get this output.
 

821
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,870
And so after that, we get this output.
You can see it starts off with a natural

822
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
You can see it starts off with a natural
 

823
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,269
You can see it starts off with a natural

828
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720

829
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,069

831
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,350
phone. She's wearing a light blue shirt.
And then down here is where you can see

832
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
And then down here is where you can see
 

833
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,110
And then down here is where you can see
what the dialogue says. So, I love how

834
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
what the dialogue says. So, I love how
 

835
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,710
what the dialogue says. So, I love how
it's so light. I almost forget it's on,

836
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
it's so light. I almost forget it's on,
 

837
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,310
it's so light. I almost forget it's on,
but it pushes a ton of air and the

838
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
but it pushes a ton of air and the
 

839
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,150
but it pushes a ton of air and the
battery lasts all afternoon. So, that

840
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
battery lasts all afternoon. So, that
 

841
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,670
battery lasts all afternoon. So, that
basically took the product features that

842
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
basically took the product features that
 

843
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,190
basically took the product features that
we had given it and it made a quick

844
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
we had given it and it made a quick
 

845
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,069
we had given it and it made a quick
little blurb for this influencer to say

846
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
little blurb for this influencer to say
 

847
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,150
little blurb for this influencer to say
in the video. Now, we're going to take

848
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
in the video. Now, we're going to take
 

849
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,069
in the video. Now, we're going to take
this video prompt and we're going to

850
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
this video prompt and we're going to
 

851
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,030
this video prompt and we're going to
feed that into key once again and we're

852
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
feed that into key once again and we're
 

853
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,829
feed that into key once again and we're
going to send it to VO3.1. So, here is

854
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
going to send it to VO3.1. So, here is
 

855
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,910
going to send it to VO3.1. So, here is
our HTTP request where we're submitting

856
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
our HTTP request where we're submitting
 

857
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,990
our HTTP request where we're submitting
an order to VO3.1.

858
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
an order to VO3.1.
 

859
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,430
an order to VO3.1.
I'm going to open up this body, and you

860
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm going to open up this body, and you
 

861
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,350
I'm going to open up this body, and you
can see that we have a prompt, which is

862
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
can see that we have a prompt, which is
 

863
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,710
can see that we have a prompt, which is
exactly what we just got from the lefth

864
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
exactly what we just got from the lefth
 

865
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,230
exactly what we just got from the lefth
hand side. Now, the reason it looks all

866
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
hand side. Now, the reason it looks all
 

867
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,670
hand side. Now, the reason it looks all
messy like this is because I'm actually

868
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
messy like this is because I'm actually
 

869
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,829
messy like this is because I'm actually
using three replace functions. I'm just

870
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
using three replace functions. I'm just
 

871
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,269
using three replace functions. I'm just
going to replace new lines, which we

872
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
going to replace new lines, which we
 

873
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,629
going to replace new lines, which we
already talked about. I'm going to

874
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
already talked about. I'm going to
 

875
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,310
already talked about. I'm going to
replace double quotes right here. It

876
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
replace double quotes right here. It
 

877
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,829
replace double quotes right here. It
previously said, I love how it's so

878
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
previously said, I love how it's so
 

879
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,430
previously said, I love how it's so
light and pushes a ton of air, and this

880
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
light and pushes a ton of air, and this
 

881
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,030
light and pushes a ton of air, and this
was wrapped in double quotes, but we

882
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
was wrapped in double quotes, but we
 

883
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,710
was wrapped in double quotes, but we
took those away because that will also

884
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
took those away because that will also
 

885
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,870
took those away because that will also
break the JSON body. And then I also had

886
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
break the JSON body. And then I also had
 

887
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,190
break the JSON body. And then I also had
to add another one. Sometimes based on

888
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
to add another one. Sometimes based on
 

889
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,629
to add another one. Sometimes based on
your chat model, it can be really weird

890
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
your chat model, it can be really weird
 

891
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,790
your chat model, it can be really weird
and output these double curly quotes

892
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
and output these double curly quotes
 

893
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,150
and output these double curly quotes
which don't actually get captured with

894
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
which don't actually get captured with
 

895
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,990
which don't actually get captured with
this previous replace function. So I

896
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
this previous replace function. So I
 

897
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,269
this previous replace function. So I
threw in this one just as an extra

898
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
threw in this one just as an extra
 

899
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,629
threw in this one just as an extra
guardrail which you guys will already

900
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
guardrail which you guys will already
 

901
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,829
guardrail which you guys will already
have all this set up. So you should be

902
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
have all this set up. So you should be
 

903
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,829
have all this set up. So you should be
good to go. But now we're basically

904
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
good to go. But now we're basically
 

905
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,190
good to go. But now we're basically
ensuring that our request will go

906
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,200
ensuring that our request will go
 

907
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,870
ensuring that our request will go
through. You can see once again we're

908
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
through. You can see once again we're
 

909
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,790
through. You can see once again we're
giving it the image URL except for this

910
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
giving it the image URL except for this
 

911
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,870
giving it the image URL except for this
one is actually the image you know it's

912
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
one is actually the image you know it's
 

913
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,710
one is actually the image you know it's
this one that Nano Banana made for us.

914
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
this one that Nano Banana made for us.
 

915
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,470
this one that Nano Banana made for us.
And then for the model we're saying V3

916
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
And then for the model we're saying V3
 

917
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,990
And then for the model we're saying V3
fast. We're using fast instead of

918
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
fast. We're using fast instead of
 

919
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,430
fast. We're using fast instead of
quality because it's cheaper and it's

920
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
quality because it's cheaper and it's
 

921
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,110
quality because it's cheaper and it's
faster and it's still really good. And I

922
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
faster and it's still really good. And I
 

923
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,870
faster and it's still really good. And I
know this says V3, but trust me, this is

924
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
know this says V3, but trust me, this is
 

925
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,990
know this says V3, but trust me, this is
using V3.1. And then aspect ratio 9x6.

926
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
using V3.1. And then aspect ratio 9x6.
 

927
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,350
using V3.1. And then aspect ratio 9x6.
We wanted to make sure that it matches

928
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
We wanted to make sure that it matches
 

929
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,389
We wanted to make sure that it matches
the source image. So now that we have

930
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
the source image. So now that we have
 

931
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,910
the source image. So now that we have
that, it basically does the exact same

932
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
that, it basically does the exact same
 

933
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,750
that, it basically does the exact same
thing. It gives us back a order number

934
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
thing. It gives us back a order number
 

935
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,829
thing. It gives us back a order number
or some sort of ticket. And we go ahead

936
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
or some sort of ticket. And we go ahead
 

937
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,750
or some sort of ticket. And we go ahead
and wait for 10 seconds right here. We

938
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
and wait for 10 seconds right here. We
 

939
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,670
and wait for 10 seconds right here. We
then go ahead and check back in on this

940
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
then go ahead and check back in on this
 

941
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,590
then go ahead and check back in on this
request, giving it our order number to

942
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
request, giving it our order number to
 

943
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,269
request, giving it our order number to
make to see if it's done or not. And

944
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
make to see if it's done or not. And
 

945
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,110
make to see if it's done or not. And
then you can see this happened eight

946
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
then you can see this happened eight
 

947
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,110
then you can see this happened eight
times. And so we basically checked in

948
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
times. And so we basically checked in
 

949
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,430
times. And so we basically checked in
eight times. So a total of 80 seconds.

950
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
eight times. So a total of 80 seconds.
 

951
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,189
eight times. So a total of 80 seconds.
So almost a minute and a half. And then

952
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
So almost a minute and a half. And then
 

953
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,310
So almost a minute and a half. And then
when we realize that the order is

954
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
when we realize that the order is
 

955
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,750
when we realize that the order is
actually done, we go ahead and we write

956
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
actually done, we go ahead and we write
 

957
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,509
actually done, we go ahead and we write
back to Google Sheets. And let me show

958
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
back to Google Sheets. And let me show
 

959
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,430
back to Google Sheets. And let me show
you real quick how we set up this Google

960
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
you real quick how we set up this Google
 

961
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,030
you real quick how we set up this Google
sheet right back. So we're using the

962
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
sheet right back. So we're using the
 

963
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,750
sheet right back. So we're using the
operation to update the row. And we

964
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
operation to update the row. And we
 

965
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,189
operation to update the row. And we
choose our sheet. Of course, we shoot we

966
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
choose our sheet. Of course, we shoot we
 

967
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,710
choose our sheet. Of course, we shoot we
choose our document. And then it says

968
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
choose our document. And then it says
 

969
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,069
choose our document. And then it says
that we have to match on a certain

970
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
that we have to match on a certain
 

971
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,470
that we have to match on a certain
column. So what we decide to do is match

972
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
column. So what we decide to do is match
 

973
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,030
column. So what we decide to do is match
on the column number. So you can see

974
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
on the column number. So you can see
 

975
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,790
on the column number. So you can see
right here, all of these rows have a

976
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
right here, all of these rows have a
 

977
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,389
right here, all of these rows have a
different unique number. And when the

978
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
different unique number. And when the
 

979
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,230
different unique number. And when the
workflow gets triggered, if we go all

980
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
workflow gets triggered, if we go all
 

981
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,389
workflow gets triggered, if we go all
the way back down to our initial get

982
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
the way back down to our initial get
 

983
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,230
the way back down to our initial get
rows, you can see that this row came in

984
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
rows, you can see that this row came in
 

985
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,470
rows, you can see that this row came in
and it was row number 10 or technically

986
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
and it was row number 10 or technically
 

987
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,069
and it was row number 10 or technically
row number 11, but the number was 10.

988
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
row number 11, but the number was 10.
 

989
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,509
row number 11, but the number was 10.
And so we're basically going to drag in

990
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
And so we're basically going to drag in
 

991
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,110
And so we're basically going to drag in
the number right here and say, okay, the

992
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
the number right here and say, okay, the
 

993
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,870
the number right here and say, okay, the
row that we want to update is the row

994
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
row that we want to update is the row
 

995
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,670
row that we want to update is the row
where the number column equals 10. And

996
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
where the number column equals 10. And
 

997
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,430
where the number column equals 10. And
so that's why it was able to write back

998
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
so that's why it was able to write back
 

999
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,949
so that's why it was able to write back
to this row right here, which you can

1000
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
to this row right here, which you can
 

1001
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,470
to this row right here, which you can
now see has been changed to status

1002
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
now see has been changed to status
 

1003
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,310
now see has been changed to status
finished. And we have our finished file

1004
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
finished. And we have our finished file
 

1005
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,509
finished. And we have our finished file
right here. because in Nitn we manually

1006
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
right here. because in Nitn we manually
 

1007
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,189
right here. because in Nitn we manually
set the status to be finished and then

1008
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
set the status to be finished and then
 

1009
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,269
set the status to be finished and then
we drag in the finished video URL that

1010
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
we drag in the finished video URL that
 

1011
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,430
we drag in the finished video URL that
we just got back from our key request.

1012
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
we just got back from our key request.
 

1013
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,030
we just got back from our key request.
And so that's basically the full process

1014
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
And so that's basically the full process
 

1015
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,310
And so that's basically the full process
and that's the most complicated one

1016
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
and that's the most complicated one
 

1017
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,150
and that's the most complicated one
because both the top one and the bottom

1018
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
because both the top one and the bottom
 

1019
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,710
because both the top one and the bottom
one are just doing reference image to

1020
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
one are just doing reference image to
 

1021
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,790
one are just doing reference image to
video rather than reference image to

1022
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
video rather than reference image to
 

1023
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,870
video rather than reference image to
image and then taking that image to

1024
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
image and then taking that image to
 

1025
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,550
image and then taking that image to
video. So anyways, we just covered the

1026
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
video. So anyways, we just covered the
 

1027
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,750
video. So anyways, we just covered the
hardest one and then we'll look at the

1028
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:43,760
hardest one and then we'll look at the
 

1029
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,509
hardest one and then we'll look at the
other ones. But real quick, let's just

1030
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
other ones. But real quick, let's just
 

1031
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,350
other ones. But real quick, let's just
go look at the actual output because of

1032
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
go look at the actual output because of
 

1033
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,509
go look at the actual output because of
course I'm very curious. I love how it's

1034
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
course I'm very curious. I love how it's
 

1035
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,910
course I'm very curious. I love how it's
so light I almost forget it's on, but it

1036
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
so light I almost forget it's on, but it
 

1037
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,030
so light I almost forget it's on, but it
pushes tons of air and the battery lasts

1038
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
pushes tons of air and the battery lasts
 

1039
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,069
pushes tons of air and the battery lasts
all afternoon.

1040
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
all afternoon.
 

1041
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,430
all afternoon.
>> That's really impressive. I was nervous

1042
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
>> That's really impressive. I was nervous
 

1043
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,269
>> That's really impressive. I was nervous
to see because it's different from

1044
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
to see because it's different from
 

1045
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,629
to see because it's different from
someone holding a product. She's

1046
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
someone holding a product. She's
 

1047
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,150
someone holding a product. She's
actually wearing it. But I mean, the

1048
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
actually wearing it. But I mean, the
 

1049
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,069
actually wearing it. But I mean, the
voice was really good. The tonality was

1050
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
voice was really good. The tonality was
 

1051
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,430
voice was really good. The tonality was
good. I thought that this was an

1052
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
good. I thought that this was an
 

1053
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,749
good. I thought that this was an
impressive result. But let's move on to

1054
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
impressive result. But let's move on to
 

1055
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,990
impressive result. But let's move on to
the next one, which is Sora 2. So, what

1056
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
the next one, which is Sora 2. So, what
 

1057
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,030
the next one, which is Sora 2. So, what
I'm going to do is go back into the

1058
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm going to do is go back into the
 

1059
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,829
I'm going to do is go back into the
workflow and I'm going to execute it.

1060
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
workflow and I'm going to execute it.
 

1061
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,430
workflow and I'm going to execute it.
What this is going to do is pull in the

1062
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
What this is going to do is pull in the
 

1063
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,590
What this is going to do is pull in the
next And you can see it got pushed down

1064
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
next And you can see it got pushed down
 

1065
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,150
next And you can see it got pushed down
to Sora 2 because when it does this

1066
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
to Sora 2 because when it does this
 

1067
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,990
to Sora 2 because when it does this
check for the model, it knows that the

1068
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
check for the model, it knows that the
 

1069
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,710
check for the model, it knows that the
model was right here marked off as Sora

1070
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
model was right here marked off as Sora
 

1071
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,870
model was right here marked off as Sora
2. So I'm honestly not going to spend as

1072
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
2. So I'm honestly not going to spend as
 

1073
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,790
2. So I'm honestly not going to spend as
much time in these next two flows

1074
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
much time in these next two flows
 

1075
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,230
much time in these next two flows
because you guys pretty much already

1076
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
because you guys pretty much already
 

1077
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,230
because you guys pretty much already
understand exactly what's going on. We

1078
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
understand exactly what's going on. We
 

1079
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,069
understand exactly what's going on. We
have this video prompt agent which once

1080
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
have this video prompt agent which once
 

1081
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,069
have this video prompt agent which once
again is looking at the product, the

1082
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
again is looking at the product, the
 

1083
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,470
again is looking at the product, the
product ICP, the product features, and

1084
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
product ICP, the product features, and
 

1085
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,990
product ICP, the product features, and
the video setting. The only difference

1086
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
the video setting. The only difference
 

1087
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,150
the video setting. The only difference
here is that it doesn't have a analysis

1088
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
here is that it doesn't have a analysis
 

1089
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,990
here is that it doesn't have a analysis
of the reference image because it'll

1090
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
of the reference image because it'll
 

1091
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,470
of the reference image because it'll
just be given that. But the system

1092
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
just be given that. But the system
 

1093
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,069
just be given that. But the system
prompt once again we basically say

1094
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
prompt once again we basically say
 

1095
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,990
prompt once again we basically say
you're an advanced UGC video creator.

1096
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
you're an advanced UGC video creator.
 

1097
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,829
you're an advanced UGC video creator.
You're optimizing for video prompts for

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
You're optimizing for video prompts for
 

1099
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,310
You're optimizing for video prompts for
Sora 2. Here is what you'll be given.

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
Sora 2. Here is what you'll be given.
 

1101
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,990
Sora 2. Here is what you'll be given.
And we go over basically the same exact

prompt as you can see down there. So

1112
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
prompt as you can see down there. So
 

1113
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,949
prompt as you can see down there. So
what that does is it once again it

1114
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
what that does is it once again it
 

1115
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,549
what that does is it once again it
outputs us a video prompt. And you can

1116
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
outputs us a video prompt. And you can
 

1117
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,390
outputs us a video prompt. And you can
see in this one there actually are new

1118
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
see in this one there actually are new
 

1119
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,669
see in this one there actually are new
lines. So, good thing we have that

1120
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
lines. So, good thing we have that
 

1121
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,189
lines. So, good thing we have that
guardrail baked in to get rid of those

1122
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
guardrail baked in to get rid of those
 

1123
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,909
guardrail baked in to get rid of those
new lines. As you can see in this HTTP

1124
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
new lines. As you can see in this HTTP
 

1125
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,270
new lines. As you can see in this HTTP

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
is store to image to video. Here is the
 

1131
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,549
is store to image to video. Here is the
prompt. And of course, we're using all

1132
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
prompt. And of course, we're using all
 

1133
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,549
prompt. And of course, we're using all
of those nasty replace functions once

1134
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
of those nasty replace functions once
 

1135
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,070
of those nasty replace functions once
again. We've got the image URL, which

1136
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
again. We've got the image URL, which
 

1137
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,350
again. We've got the image URL, which
we're grabbing from the Google sheet,

1138
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
we're grabbing from the Google sheet,
 

1139
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,190
we're grabbing from the Google sheet,
which once again looks like this right

1140
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
which once again looks like this right
 

1141
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,870
which once again looks like this right
there. And we're basically just sending

1142
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
there. And we're basically just sending
 

1143
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,470
there. And we're basically just sending
all of that over. And so, it's going to

1144
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
all of that over. And so, it's going to
 

1145
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,390
all of that over. And so, it's going to
take that video prompt and it's going to

1146
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
take that video prompt and it's going to
 

1147
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,230
take that video prompt and it's going to
take that source image and it's going to

1148
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
take that source image and it's going to
 

1149
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,070
take that source image and it's going to
turn that into a video. We're doing the

1150
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
turn that into a video. We're doing the
 

1151
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,430
turn that into a video. We're doing the
exact same thing here where, you know,

1152
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
exact same thing here where, you know,
 

1153
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,789
exact same thing here where, you know,
we submitted the order, we have to wait

1154
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
we submitted the order, we have to wait
 

1155
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,789
we submitted the order, we have to wait
10 seconds and then check in and we're

1156
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
10 seconds and then check in and we're
 

1157
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,150
10 seconds and then check in and we're
going to go ahead and constantly be

1158
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
going to go ahead and constantly be
 

1159
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,990
going to go ahead and constantly be
checking until we know that our video is

1160
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
checking until we know that our video is
 

1161
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,669
checking until we know that our video is
done. On average, I have been seeing

1162
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
done. On average, I have been seeing
 

1163
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,230
done. On average, I have been seeing
that V3 fast is finishing in anywhere

1164
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
that V3 fast is finishing in anywhere
 

1165
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,230
that V3 fast is finishing in anywhere
from a minute to 2 minutes. And Sora 2

1166
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
from a minute to 2 minutes. And Sora 2
 

1167
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,750
from a minute to 2 minutes. And Sora 2
has been taking typically a little bit

1168
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
has been taking typically a little bit
 

1169
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,029
has been taking typically a little bit
more than that, maybe a minute and a

1170
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
more than that, maybe a minute and a
 

1171
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,630
more than that, maybe a minute and a
half to 3 minutes. There are a few

1172
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
half to 3 minutes. There are a few
 

1173
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,070
half to 3 minutes. There are a few
things to consider. Sometimes if you do

1174
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
things to consider. Sometimes if you do
 

1175
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,270
things to consider. Sometimes if you do
something like a cameo, it's going to

1176
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
something like a cameo, it's going to
 

1177
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,789
something like a cameo, it's going to
take longer. If you've got a really long

1178
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
take longer. If you've got a really long
 

1179
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,549
take longer. If you've got a really long
video prompt, it'll take longer. Also,

1180
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
video prompt, it'll take longer. Also,
 

1181
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,909
video prompt, it'll take longer. Also,
what can influence it is how many people

1182
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
what can influence it is how many people
 

1183
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,669
what can influence it is how many people
in the world are trying to use keys

1184
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
in the world are trying to use keys
 

1185
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,350
in the world are trying to use keys
endpoints. that can make it take longer,

1186
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
endpoints. that can make it take longer,
 

1187
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,909
endpoints. that can make it take longer,
too. But typically, Google V3 fast is

1188
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
too. But typically, Google V3 fast is
 

1189
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,669
too. But typically, Google V3 fast is
faster, but it's the exact same flow

1190
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
faster, but it's the exact same flow
 

1191
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,350
faster, but it's the exact same flow
from there. We're pulling it back in.

1192
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
from there. We're pulling it back in.
 

1193
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,270
from there. We're pulling it back in.
We're doing the same match to update the

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
We're doing the same match to update the
 

1195
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,470
We're doing the same match to update the
row, and then we're just updating the

1196
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
row, and then we're just updating the
 

1197
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,310
row, and then we're just updating the
status of finished. And we are putting

1198
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
status of finished. And we are putting
 

1199
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,470
status of finished. And we are putting
in the final video link into the Google

1200
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
in the final video link into the Google
 

1201
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,909
in the final video link into the Google
sheet. There you go. It looks like it

1202
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
sheet. There you go. It looks like it
 

1203
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,350
sheet. There you go. It looks like it
just finished up. Let's go back into the

1204
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
just finished up. Let's go back into the
 

1205
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,870
just finished up. Let's go back into the
Google sheet. It just got marked as

1206
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
Google sheet. It just got marked as
 

1207
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,390
Google sheet. It just got marked as
finished. And we have our file. So,

1208
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
finished. And we have our file. So,
 

1209
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,590
finished. And we have our file. So,
let's take a look at the Sora 2 output.

1210
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
let's take a look at the Sora 2 output.
 

1211
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,350
let's take a look at the Sora 2 output.
>> Man, this thing is so light and the

1212
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
>> Man, this thing is so light and the
 

1213
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,909
>> Man, this thing is so light and the
airflow hits my face perfectly. Keeps me

1214
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
airflow hits my face perfectly. Keeps me
 

1215
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,150
airflow hits my face perfectly. Keeps me
cool while I work. And the battery lasts

1216
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
cool while I work. And the battery lasts
 

1217
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,590
cool while I work. And the battery lasts
for hours, so I don't have to worry

1218
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
for hours, so I don't have to worry
 

1219
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,110
for hours, so I don't have to worry
about it dying out here.

1220
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
about it dying out here.
 

1221
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,630
about it dying out here.
>> Man, well, that was another really good

1222
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
>> Man, well, that was another really good
 

1223
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,070
>> Man, well, that was another really good
one. A little bit confused where this

1224
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
one. A little bit confused where this
 

1225
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,430
one. A little bit confused where this
thing came from. That was a bit of a

1226
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
thing came from. That was a bit of a
 

1227
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,029
thing came from. That was a bit of a
hallucination, but as you can see, this

1228
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
hallucination, but as you can see, this
 

1229
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,310
hallucination, but as you can see, this
was the reference image, and it looks

1230
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
was the reference image, and it looks
 

1231
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,549
was the reference image, and it looks
really good in this video. Super

1232
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
really good in this video. Super
 

1233
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,669
really good in this video. Super
authentic, and it looks like she's

1234
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
authentic, and it looks like she's
 

1235
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,430
authentic, and it looks like she's
obviously standing there taking a selfie

1236
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
obviously standing there taking a selfie
 

1237
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,950
obviously standing there taking a selfie
video. All right, so the final one for

1238
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
video. All right, so the final one for
 

1239
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,190
video. All right, so the final one for
this example is V3.1. So, I'm going to

1240
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
this example is V3.1. So, I'm going to
 

1241
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,029
this example is V3.1. So, I'm going to
go ahead and zoom out a little bit, hit

1242
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
go ahead and zoom out a little bit, hit
 

1243
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,789
go ahead and zoom out a little bit, hit
execute workflow, and it should shoot it

1244
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
execute workflow, and it should shoot it
 

1245
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,110
execute workflow, and it should shoot it
up this top branch now. And I'm honestly

1246
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
up this top branch now. And I'm honestly
 

1247
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,070
up this top branch now. And I'm honestly
not even going to break this down

1248
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
not even going to break this down
 

1249
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,230
not even going to break this down
because it's the exact same thing. I

1250
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
because it's the exact same thing. I
 

1251
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,669
because it's the exact same thing. I
copied over basically the exact same

1252
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
copied over basically the exact same
 

1253
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,070
copied over basically the exact same
system prompt. I just switched out 10

1254
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
system prompt. I just switched out 10
 

1255
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,510
system prompt. I just switched out 10
seconds, which is how long the Sor

1256
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
seconds, which is how long the Sor
 

1257
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,430
seconds, which is how long the Sor
videos are, for 8 seconds for how long

1258
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
videos are, for 8 seconds for how long
 

1259
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,750
videos are, for 8 seconds for how long
the V3.1 videos are. And then I switched

1260
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
the V3.1 videos are. And then I switched
 

1261
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,549
the V3.1 videos are. And then I switched
out sore 2 for V3.1. But I wanted to

1262
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
out sore 2 for V3.1. But I wanted to
 

1263
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,470
out sore 2 for V3.1. But I wanted to
keep these prompts across all of these

1264
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
keep these prompts across all of these
 

1265
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,510
keep these prompts across all of these

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880

1272
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
models when we have as many things
 

1273
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,070
models when we have as many things
consistent as we can. So, I'm just going

1274
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
consistent as we can. So, I'm just going
 

1275
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,190
consistent as we can. So, I'm just going
to let this finish up and I will check

1276
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
to let this finish up and I will check
 

1277
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,549
to let this finish up and I will check
in with you guys when we get our

1278
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
in with you guys when we get our
 

1279
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,870
in with you guys when we get our
finished output from V3.1. All right, so

1280
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
finished output from V3.1. All right, so
 

1281
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,909
finished output from V3.1. All right, so
you can see that that one just finished

1282
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
you can see that that one just finished
 

1283
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,390
you can see that that one just finished
up. Once again, took about 80 seconds.

1284
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
up. Once again, took about 80 seconds.
 

1285
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,990
up. Once again, took about 80 seconds.
Let's go ahead and make sure we got this

1286
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's go ahead and make sure we got this
 

1287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,390
Let's go ahead and make sure we got this
updated. And let's take a look at the

1288
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
updated. And let's take a look at the
 

1289
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,990
updated. And let's take a look at the
V3.1 output.

1290
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
V3.1 output.
 

1291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,150
V3.1 output.

actually blows enough air to keep me

1294
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
actually blows enough air to keep me
 

1295
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,470
actually blows enough air to keep me
cool for hours while I'm working.

1296
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480

1297
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,230

>> Okay, so it's not too bad. I honestly

1298
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
>> Okay, so it's not too bad. I honestly
 

1299

think that right now my my order is this

1300
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
think that right now my my order is this
 

1301
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,230
think that right now my my order is this
exact order that we have here, which is

1302
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
exact order that we have here, which is
 

1303
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,750
exact order that we have here, which is
Nano plus V3.1, then Sora 2, then just

1304
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
Nano plus V3.1, then Sora 2, then just
 

1305
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,470
Nano plus V3.1, then Sora 2, then just
V3.1. A lot of these VO ones have like

1306
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
V3.1. A lot of these VO ones have like
 

1307
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,390
V3.1. A lot of these VO ones have like
this super HDR weird orange glow looking

1308
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
this super HDR weird orange glow looking
 

1309
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,669
this super HDR weird orange glow looking
effect. I'm not sure if you guys had

1310
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
effect. I'm not sure if you guys had
 

1311
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,110
effect. I'm not sure if you guys had
noticed that. Here's another example of

1312
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
noticed that. Here's another example of
 

1313
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,669
noticed that. Here's another example of
the VO3.1. It's not it's not terrible,

1314
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
the VO3.1. It's not it's not terrible,
 

1315
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,110
the VO3.1. It's not it's not terrible,
but just in comparison to some of the

1316
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
but just in comparison to some of the
 

1317
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,470
but just in comparison to some of the
other ones, it definitely looks a bit

1318
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
other ones, it definitely looks a bit
 

1319
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,710
other ones, it definitely looks a bit
more orange. And then another thing I

1320
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
more orange. And then another thing I
 

1321
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190
more orange. And then another thing I
noticed is this is the V3.1 example, and

1322
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
noticed is this is the V3.1 example, and
 

1323
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,190
noticed is this is the V3.1 example, and
I explicitly told it to not change

1324
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
I explicitly told it to not change
 

1325
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,549
I explicitly told it to not change
anything about the reference image

1326
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
anything about the reference image
 

1327
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,150
anything about the reference image
itself, but we can see the creatine

1328
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
itself, but we can see the creatine
 

1329
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,070
itself, but we can see the creatine
gummies is a jar and then in the video

1330
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
gummies is a jar and then in the video
 

1331
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,470
gummies is a jar and then in the video
it's a bag. And so it does have the same

1332
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
it's a bag. And so it does have the same
 

1333
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,390
it's a bag. And so it does have the same
branding and same font as you can see.

1334
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
branding and same font as you can see.
 

1335
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,830
branding and same font as you can see.
He even actually, this is funny, he's

1336
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840

1337
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,029

got the logo on his hoodie, which is

1338
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
got the logo on his hoodie, which is
 

1339
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,270
got the logo on his hoodie, which is
honestly a nice touch, but this is a

1340
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
honestly a nice touch, but this is a
 

1341
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,430
honestly a nice touch, but this is a
bag. And in the source image, it was a

1342
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
bag. And in the source image, it was a
 

1343
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,270
bag. And in the source image, it was a
jar. And the other creatine ones didn't

1344
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
jar. And the other creatine ones didn't
 

1345
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,789
jar. And the other creatine ones didn't
have a bag. They had the the correct

1346
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
have a bag. They had the the correct
 

1347
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,230
have a bag. They had the the correct
jar, too. And I know we didn't look at

1348
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
jar, too. And I know we didn't look at
 

1349
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,990
jar, too. And I know we didn't look at
the forearm strengthener example, but

1350
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
the forearm strengthener example, but
 

1351
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,750
the forearm strengthener example, but
this was another one where, for example,

1352
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
this was another one where, for example,
 

1353
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,750

grip get stronger week to week, and it's
 

1361
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,510

small enough to use right at my desk.

1362
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520

that I gave it, which looked like this,
 

1369
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,430
that I gave it, which looked like this,
as you can see right here. But then that

1370
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
as you can see right here. But then that
 

1371
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,310

same one with VO3.1 without Nano Banana.

1372

same one with VO3.1 without Nano Banana.
 

1373
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,070
same one with VO3.1 without Nano Banana.
Once again, it looks a bit it has some

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
Once again, it looks a bit it has some
 

1375
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,350
Once again, it looks a bit it has some
weird shadows and it looks orange.

1386
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520

1387
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,230

So that's kind of like a huge no no for

1388
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
So that's kind of like a huge no no for
 

1389
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,990
So that's kind of like a huge no no for
me. And another thing that you guys will

1390
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
me. And another thing that you guys will
 

1391
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,789
me. And another thing that you guys will
notice when you send a source image and

1392
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
notice when you send a source image and
 

1393
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,630
notice when you send a source image and
you turn that into a video both with

1394
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
you turn that into a video both with
 

1395
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,750
you turn that into a video both with
V3.1 and Sora is the first frame is the

1396
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
V3.1 and Sora is the first frame is the
 

1397
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,350
V3.1 and Sora is the first frame is the
reference image. And this is that first

1398
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
reference image. And this is that first
 

1399
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,029
reference image. And this is that first
creatine example we looked at with sore

1400
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
creatine example we looked at with sore
 

1401
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,390
creatine example we looked at with sore
2. And you'll notice the very first

1402
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
2. And you'll notice the very first
 

1403
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,630
2. And you'll notice the very first
frame is once again the reference image.

1404
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
frame is once again the reference image.
 

1405
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,789
frame is once again the reference image.
And so when we do nanobanana plus Google

1406
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
And so when we do nanobanana plus Google
 

1407
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,149
And so when we do nanobanana plus Google
V3.1 it still does that but our

1408
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
V3.1 it still does that but our
 

1409
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,789
V3.1 it still does that but our
reference image is this. So it just is

1410
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
reference image is this. So it just is
 

1411
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,630
reference image is this. So it just is
able to you know pick up right from here

1412
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
able to you know pick up right from here
 

1413
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,789
able to you know pick up right from here
and it looks way more natural. So the

1414
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
and it looks way more natural. So the
 

1415
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,149
and it looks way more natural. So the
point being you could kind of like

1416
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
point being you could kind of like
 

1417
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,149
point being you could kind of like
automate the content creation and you

1418
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
automate the content creation and you
 

1419
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,710
automate the content creation and you
could have it auto post as well with

1420
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
could have it auto post as well with
 

1421
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,710
could have it auto post as well with
this branch, but I probably wouldn't

1422
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
this branch, but I probably wouldn't
 

1423
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,190
this branch, but I probably wouldn't
auto post Google V3 like this or sore 2

1424
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
auto post Google V3 like this or sore 2
 

1425
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,190
auto post Google V3 like this or sore 2
like this because of that whole first

1426
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
like this because of that whole first
 

1427
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,750
like this because of that whole first
frame, first couple milliseconds thing.

1428
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
frame, first couple milliseconds thing.
 

1429
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,110
frame, first couple milliseconds thing.
Now some people argue that it's good

1430
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
Now some people argue that it's good
 

1431
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,630
Now some people argue that it's good
because then you have a thumbnail, but

1432
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
because then you have a thumbnail, but
 

1433
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,549
because then you have a thumbnail, but
then every single thumbnail on your feed

1434
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
then every single thumbnail on your feed
 

1435
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,789
then every single thumbnail on your feed
would look the exact same and that I

1436
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
would look the exact same and that I
 

1437
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,710
would look the exact same and that I
think would just come across really bad.

1438
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
think would just come across really bad.
 

1439
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,789
think would just come across really bad.
So that's why I think right now my

1440
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
So that's why I think right now my
 

1441
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,950
So that's why I think right now my
favorite is honestly Nanobanana plus

1442
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
favorite is honestly Nanobanana plus
 

1443
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,470
favorite is honestly Nanobanana plus
V3.1.

1444
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
V3.1.
 

1445
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,070
V3.1.
Now I think Sora would give it a run for

1446
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
Now I think Sora would give it a run for
 

1447
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,390
Now I think Sora would give it a run for
its money if it allowed you to upload a

1448
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
its money if it allowed you to upload a
 

1449
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,230
its money if it allowed you to upload a
realistic photo of a human. Because if

1450
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
realistic photo of a human. Because if
 

1451
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,750
realistic photo of a human. Because if
we go back to this first example with

1452
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
we go back to this first example with
 

1453
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,909
we go back to this first example with
the portable neck fan when Nano Banana

1454
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
the portable neck fan when Nano Banana
 

1455
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,669
the portable neck fan when Nano Banana
made that image, even though this is a

1456
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
made that image, even though this is a
 

1457
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,909
made that image, even though this is a
fake person and an AI generated image,

1458
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
fake person and an AI generated image,
 

1459
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,750
fake person and an AI generated image,
if you tried to feed that into Soore 2,

1460
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
if you tried to feed that into Soore 2,
 

1461
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,430
if you tried to feed that into Soore 2,
it would block you because of content

1462
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
it would block you because of content
 

1463
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,590
it would block you because of content
restrictions. So that's why this combo

1464
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
restrictions. So that's why this combo
 

1465
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,510
restrictions. So that's why this combo
has my vote right now. But another thing

1466
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
has my vote right now. But another thing
 

1467
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,590
has my vote right now. But another thing
to consider, of course, is cost. So

1468
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
to consider, of course, is cost. So
 

1469
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,110
to consider, of course, is cost. So
comparing these options, I guess there

1470
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
comparing these options, I guess there
 

1471
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,870
comparing these options, I guess there
were technically three, but let's just

1472
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
were technically three, but let's just
 

1473
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,630
were technically three, but let's just
look at these two because V3 is in here

1474
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
look at these two because V3 is in here
 

1475
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,870
look at these two because V3 is in here
for both. But option one is nanobanana

1476
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
for both. But option one is nanobanana
 

1477
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,430
for both. But option one is nanobanana
plus V3 fast. When you're going through

1478
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
plus V3 fast. When you're going through
 

1479
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,350
plus V3 fast. When you're going through
KI, which is the one that we were on

1480
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
KI, which is the one that we were on
 

1481
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,270
KI, which is the one that we were on
right up here, a nano banana image is

1482
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
right up here, a nano banana image is
 

1483
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,190
right up here, a nano banana image is
going to cost you 2 cents. So not bad.

1484
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
going to cost you 2 cents. So not bad.
 

1485
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,750
going to cost you 2 cents. So not bad.
And an 8second V3 fast video will cost

1486
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
And an 8second V3 fast video will cost
 

1487
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,710
And an 8second V3 fast video will cost
you 30. So total cost per piece of

1488
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
you 30. So total cost per piece of
 

1489
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,669
you 30. So total cost per piece of
content with this system would be 32.

1490
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
content with this system would be 32.
 

1491
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,110
content with this system would be 32.
Now, for option two, if you're using

1492
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
Now, for option two, if you're using
 

1493
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,350
Now, for option two, if you're using
Sora 2 and you're going through KAI,

1494
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
Sora 2 and you're going through KAI,
 

1495
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,870
Sora 2 and you're going through KAI,
which is the cheapest I've seen it, so

1496
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:12,880
which is the cheapest I've seen it, so
 

1497
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,029
which is the cheapest I've seen it, so
definitely do that. It will cost you 15

1498
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
definitely do that. It will cost you 15
 

1499
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,870
definitely do that. It will cost you 15
cents for 10-second video. So, really

1500
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
cents for 10-second video. So, really
 

1501
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,190
cents for 10-second video. So, really
not bad at all. About half the cost of

1502
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
not bad at all. About half the cost of
 

1503
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,909
not bad at all. About half the cost of
VO3 fast. So, option one is roughly two

1504
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
VO3 fast. So, option one is roughly two
 

1505
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,750
VO3 fast. So, option one is roughly two
times more expensive than Sora 2. So,

1506
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
times more expensive than Sora 2. So,
 

1507
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,070
times more expensive than Sora 2. So,
the question is, is it two times higher

1508
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
the question is, is it two times higher
 

1509
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,990
the question is, is it two times higher
quality and will it result in two times

1510
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
quality and will it result in two times
 

1511
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,590
quality and will it result in two times
more conversions? Or maybe it's not

1512
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
more conversions? Or maybe it's not
 

1513
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,590
more conversions? Or maybe it's not
exactly a two times match because it's a

1514
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
exactly a two times match because it's a
 

1515
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,350
exactly a two times match because it's a
lot cheaper than how much money you'd

1516
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
lot cheaper than how much money you'd
 

1517
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,070
lot cheaper than how much money you'd
make per sale or whatever it is. But

1518
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
make per sale or whatever it is. But
 

1519
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,270
make per sale or whatever it is. But
there is a bit of a trade-off there

1520
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
there is a bit of a trade-off there
 

1521
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,549
there is a bit of a trade-off there
because you can essentially make double

1522
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
because you can essentially make double
 

1523
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,230
because you can essentially make double
the amount of short form UDC content

1524
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
the amount of short form UDC content
 

1525
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,789
the amount of short form UDC content
with SOR 2 for the same price as using

1526
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
with SOR 2 for the same price as using
 

1527
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,190
with SOR 2 for the same price as using
Nano Banana and V3 Fast. So anyways, I

1528
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
Nano Banana and V3 Fast. So anyways, I
 

1529
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,390
Nano Banana and V3 Fast. So anyways, I
just wanted to sort of give you guys all

1530
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
just wanted to sort of give you guys all
 

1531
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,070
just wanted to sort of give you guys all
the info, give you the template, show

1532
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
the info, give you the template, show
 

1533
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,350
the info, give you the template, show
you the system, and explain the

1534
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
you the system, and explain the
 

1535
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,430
you the system, and explain the
differences between these two models.

1536
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
differences between these two models.
 

1537
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,950
differences between these two models.
And of course, I'm really really bullish

1538
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
And of course, I'm really really bullish
 

1539
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,950
And of course, I'm really really bullish
on all of this because the fact of the

1540
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
on all of this because the fact of the
 

1541
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,870
on all of this because the fact of the
matter is you guys can get in here and

1542
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
matter is you guys can get in here and
 

1543
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,310
matter is you guys can get in here and
make these prompts better. You can play

1544
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320

much better these models will be when
 

1555
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,190
much better these models will be when
Sora 4 comes out and when V4 comes out.
