Hey clothing brands, Google's V3 is about to kill traditional video marketing. We're talking about 8second cinematic stylized sound enabled videos from a single text prompt. You type it in and Google VO makes it real. It's like having your own literally Hollywood director, VFX team, audio engineer all rolled into one little prompt box. And yes, this is real. Hey, my name is Christian Pñan, one of the co-founders here at Bit Branding. We're specialized in helping clothing brands scale online and we've served over 300 clothing brands in the last year alone. I would appreciate it if you like and subscribe so you don't miss any of our content. Now, let me show you exactly how to use VO3 to create viral videos that sell your clothes like crazy. So, step one, you really want to understand the power of VO3. Most AI video tools out there just create kind of like the visuals, right? But VO3 goes a step further and it generates native audio. It generates realistic camera motion and video scenes that follow your instructions like a trained cinematographer. So you can create Tik Toks with storyline hooks. You can create Instagram reels with product reveals, cinematic B-rolls for paid ads and create UGC style scenes with humor and dialogue. Really the best part about this is that you can do it all in dur. And speaking of prompt, I think that's the the biggest crutch I would say with with Google's video is that you definitely need to master the prompt formula. And here's the secret sauce. You need to write your prompts like a mini movie script. So the better your prompt, the better your video. And just to show you an example, if I type in a model walks down the street wearing a jacket, it's going to give me a very simple video of a model walking. She actually doesn't even have a shirt on. It's just a jacket, which is interesting. And then listen to this. Hopefully you can we can get the audio in here. >> This jacket just makes you feel so powerful when you walk down the street. >> For whatever reason, it added that audio on top of it just saying this jacket makes you feel so powerful when walking down the street, which I guess is that's fine. It's okay. But again, you get an idea, right? A very simple prompt will kind of get you there, but it won't get you to where you truly want to go. Right now, if we do a different prompt, something with a little bit more structure. So, a confident young woman with natural curls wears a cropped caramel puffer jacket and distressed denim. She struts through a bustling downtown street at golden hour. The camera follows from a low angle in slow motion. Sunflares bouncing off glass buildings. Style is cinematic, warm tones. The audio upbeat R&B instrumental plays faint city sounds. Her heels clicking on the pavement. And this is the video that we got from that one. >> The music could be a little bit better, but we have all the right elements in here, right? We have the right model that we want. We have the camera angle that we
