So, we just give it a photo of any product and we ask it to create, let's say, 25 videos. And once that's done, we get the videos back ready to post. >> So, Tik Tok made me buy this and it turns out it's the best tasting fruit beer in Sydney. And they donate their profits to charity. And you know what? It's honestly really good. >> So, Tik Tok made me buy this >> and it turns out it's the best tasting fruit beer in Sydney. >> And they donate their profits to charity. >> And you know what? It's honestly really good. So, I saw these on Tik Tok and after a few weeks, my yoga recovery feels way better. And now I feel way more focused for my classes. Maybe it's the fish oil. They really help me with my yoga. Like my joints just feel less stiff now. I swear. So I saw this on Tik Tok. Everyone was obsessed with this book and honestly it's changing how I build my habits. For real. >> I just built this AI system that creates infinite UGC style ads for any product or brand completely on autopilot. You just tell it how many videos you want, describe the influencers that you want in your videos, either give them a script or have the system write it for you, and it generates all of those UGC ads ready for you to post. Because if, in case you don't know, today's brands are launching ads literally by the hundreds in order to test which creative works, and it's powered by AI systems like these. So once you learn this skill, you can use it for your own product. Offer it as a service for clients who need content or UGC with some client acquisition techniques explained near the end of the video or even earn passive affiliate income by driving traffic to Amazon products. What's crazy is each of these videos only costs 43 cents to make, which is orders of magnitude cheaper versus spending it on influencers for the same type of content. And remember, what you saw in the demo is the worst that it will ever be because as time goes on, the quality of these will only go up and the cost will slowly go down. So, if you're serious about taking advantage of the historic shift that AI is bringing, and with demand for AI agents and automation rising fast, if you just check Google Trends, then picking up the skill to make these AI systems, which are all no code anyway, so anyone can learn them, is bound to pay off for you in a big way. So, if you have the time, invest some today to listen to the end so that you too can master this increasingly important AI skill. Let's get started. If you're new here, my name is Jay. I run my own AI creative agency where we help mostly brands and content businesses use AI in meaningful ways. And I also founded the RoboNuggets community. We have several hundred members now who are all AI practitioners and builders located across the globe. And here our mission is simple is to make creating with AI easy to learn for anyone who wants to. That's why in all of our videos, I make sure to go through each note so that you can also understand the princip
