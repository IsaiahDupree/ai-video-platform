## Raw Transcript

So, right here is a video of a girl making a simple review of some pants that she bought online. And I thought to myself, how can I recreate the same video, but replace her outfit with my own product like this? Or even change up the background like this while preserving the same exact movements. This way, I have a fully unique video that I can use for my own products. Well, in this video, I'm going to show you how this is done by using AI motion control. So, you're probably wondering why would you want to use AI motion control to copy the same movements from other video ads. Well, the first reason is because we can use it to our advantage to copy certain concepts that are proven to work. So, for example, this is an ad that's doing well for a brand called Oi Rosie, and it's a simple 5-second video of this girl doing specific movements while she's wearing this dress. And what we can do is use AI to copy the exact same look of this video, replace it with a different model who's wearing our product, and then changing up the background. This way, we end up with a fully unique video that's not just straight up copying the ad one for one, but we're simply taking inspiration on the motion. Not only that, we can also spy on other competitors who are doing extremely well, such as this men's clothing store that's literally doing like $10,000 per day. And what I could do is look at all of their best performing ads and we could take the exact hook that they're using in their video like this. Then take our own product, put it on top of our own AI model inside of their home, and we will have our own unique version of a hook that is proven to work from another brand. And if you're still sleeping on AI ads and you don't think they actually work, here's the results of one of my stores that I ran in Q4 that literally did 130K off of one single AI ad. And here's a Facebook campaign that I've been using to test some new AI ads, which has given me a pretty solid cost per click of 86 cents and a nice rorowaz of 2.17, giving this new store a net profit of $445 in just the last week, which I think is pretty good considering that this is a new product test with a new style of ads that I'm testing with AI. And by the way, if you want to know the best way to track your profits on any of your Shopify stores, this app is called True Profit, and it gives me a clear view on a daily basis of how much I'm paying my supplier, how much I'm spending on Facebook ads, and how much I'm paying in Shopify transaction fees. You can connect all of your ad platforms in just a click of a button. And all you have to do is enter in the exact amount it costs you to fulfill all of your products on your store, and everything will be synced automatically, so you know exactly how much you're making or losing every single day. This way, you can make the proper decisions when you're running ads for your store. If you want to give this app a try, feel free to use my link down below to get a free trial
