I tested 500 meta ads using AI and almost every single one of them failed. Only five hook formulas kept winning across niches, across products, and across every creative style I threw at them. And you can create them with AI in under 5 minutes. No fancy camera needed, no hiring editors, and definitely no more paying thousands of dollars to UGC influencers. These hooks work in any niche. And if your ads aren't converting, it's probably because you're not using one of these five. And I've spent over $1 million on meta ads for clients in the ecom and software space. And my top performing campaign right now uses hook number five and has a rorowaz of over 11x. That means for every $1 I put in, I get 11 out. So, if you want those same results for your campaigns, then make sure to stick around to the end for that one. But for now, let's get into hook number one. Hook number one. My problem was bad situation. Product literally saved me. Out of the 500 hooks I tested, this first one showed up the most across ads, but most successful brands don't even realize they're using it. This is the fastest scroll stopper you can build with AI. So, let me show you why it works and when to use it. The word literally makes it feel real and emotional. You're leading with pain and that stops the scroll immediately. And this works for any product that solves a clear problem. Let me give you some examples. My skin was flaking nonstop. Caravee literally saved me. My back pain was killing me. This corrector literally saved me. I couldn't hit my protein goals. These bars literally saved me. Now, look how easy this is to create. I'm just going to upload an avatar here. Type in the script and click generate. That's it. This literally takes 2 minutes from start to finish. >> My skin was flaking non-stop. Caravee literally saved me. Now my skin's actually smooth and hydrated. Best switch I ever made. >> Here's a pro tip. Don't just make one version of this. Test three to four ways to describe the same problem. Same hook structure, but different pain language. So instead of my skin was flaking, try my skin was peeling, cracking. Same problem, different emotional trigger. And this hook works for almost anything that solves a clear problem. Skincare, supplements, fitness products, productivity tools. If it fixes something painful, this hook will crush. And hook number one works insanely well. But there is one problem with it. If your audience is even slightly skeptical, it falls apart. That's why hook number two exists. And honestly, this one surprised me the most in the data. Hook number two, I've never tried product before, believe it or not. And this hook completely removes all the sales pressure. When you say, "I've never tried this before." It feels real. It feels unbiased. And that believe it or not part creates the curiosity gap. And that's what keeps people watching because they want to know what happens next. This is perfect for trendy products that everyone's already talki
