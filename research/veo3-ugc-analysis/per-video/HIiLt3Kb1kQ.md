In this video, I want to show you how to do programmatic creative testing at scale. But first, let's figure out what it is exactly. See, an ad, it's not only um a piece of written copy or a nice picture. It's you can segment an ad into different predefined parameters. You can have a unique selling proposition you want this specific ad to push. You can have the marketing angle related to this specific unique selling proposition that you want the ad to push. You can have a specific messaging framework you want to use in your ad. You can use the awareness of your prospect related to your product or the sophistication of your market or even the length of the copy. So, as you can see, there are so many different variables that we can use to create an ad. And by an ad, I mean a hook or a longer copy that you can use as a mini VSSL or whatever the ad is. You always can segment it into different variables. So now that AI can handle the creative part, if we are able to build a system to feed the right variables to an LLM model, an AI, then the AI can actually output the ads that we want. Exactly. Which allow us to then generate hundreds or thousands of different ads, review them to make sure that they are good. So that's the human touch. and then push them right away into an ad account. So we are able to literally test with a proper structure and test every potential marketing angle and every potential combination that we want. And in this video I'm going to show you you can see two screens. Why is because here it's the thinking process behind it. So that's the most important thing in this video is actually to understand like how to think of programmatic creative testing. Uh and at the same time I'm going to show you the system that I used I built for my clients that they are currently using to scale their ad accounts and find winning ads after winning ads. Um and we will go and we will see the different uh pieces of the system one after the other. So you will not only see a spreadsheet but you will see a proper uh mental framework that you can use. So who is it for? Basically every company that is running ads on Facebook can use this system, this approach. If you are a business owner, uh this might completely change the way you think of running your paid acquisition. If you are a marketer, I think you will love it. And if you are not yet at the scale of u scaling ads or even running ads then it is worth keep watching because what you will learn the way to think of ads in a logical and structural way will probably reframe uh your approach uh so you will be a lot better of when you you get into it. So if you're new here my name is Steph France. I'm a marketer and independent consultant and on this channel I help you to generate more revenue by writing marketing copy that resonates with your customer and I do it using AI of course uh market research a lot and system thinking before everything. So let's dive into it. Just for context, the system you're going
