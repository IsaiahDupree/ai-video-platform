Okay, so I just tested something that completely blew my mind. I took viral videos from Tik Tok and recreated them with AI for different products in literally minutes. No film crew, no models, no editing, just AI doing everything. And the results, I honestly had to watch them twice because I couldn't believe they were AI generated. Look, I know what you're thinking right now. This probably needs expensive software, editing skills, maybe even a whole production team. Wrong. What I'm about to show you requires absolutely zero experience. Here's why you should listen to me. I've been testing AI video tools for over a year now. I've seen what works for viral UGC content and what's just hype. So, when I tell you this tool is different, I genuinely mean it based on real experience. Here's exactly what you're getting in this video. I'm testing Top View video agent, which is powered by OpenAI Sora 2 with three completely different real products. You'll see the full recreation process from start to finish. Side-by-side comparisons that'll make you question what's real anymore, and my completely honest reaction to how insanely good this has become. Let's get into it. If you want to follow along, head to topview.ai, link in the description, click try video agent, and you're in. The workflow is stupid simple. You need just two things. An image of your product and a viral reference video you want to recreate. That's it. Upload those two things and the AI handles everything else. Let me show you what happens behind the scenes because this is where it gets really interesting. For my first test, I went to Colada, a platform that tracks which products are crushing it on Tik Tok right now. It shows you which videos are getting the most sales, which creators are converting the best. I found these jeans that were absolutely crushing it this week. Then I grabbed a video from a creator whose content was converting like crazy based on actual sales data. I uploaded the jeans photo as my product image and her video as my reference. You choose portrait or landscape format depending on your platform. I went portrait for Tik Tok. Now watch what happens. The AI starts creating what they call a smart plan. On the left side, you can see it working through different stages. First, it analyzed your product just from the photo. It creates a full comprehensive list of features automatically. For these jeans, it picked up the wash, the fit, the style, all just from the image. Then it writes an entire video brief with an outline of what the video should be about, who the target audience is, and the key selling points. Next, this is the genius part. It analyzes why the reference video actually worked. It's not just blindly copying. It's understanding the psychology behind it. For this video, it picked up hooks like viral bloat friendly jeans and Mother over 40 as strong attention grabbers. It identified specific shot types, close-ups highlighting the stretch, moments expressing love
