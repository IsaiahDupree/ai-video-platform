AI avatars can't hold products naturally until now. Because if you're running AI avatars for your drop shipping or e-commerce stores that look like this, your ads won't convert. That's why I'm revealing the secret in this video. Motion mimicking. You simply record yourself holding any product and AI copies your exact movement onto the AI avatar. So, we're going to be covering everything in this video. The new AI model that allows us to do this, the prompts, the complete step-by-step methods. Now, just so you guys know how crazy this new AI model is, let me show you a video ad that I created for the rose teddy bear in less than 20 minutes. >> All I thought it was just flowers at first, but then I realized it's actually a rose teddy, and it's so much more thoughtful. What I love is that it doesn't die after a few days like normal flowers do. >> Now, before we get into the video, guys, there is a like goal of a,000 likes. So, make sure you destroy the like button because that shows me that you appreciate these videos and you want to see more of them. And if we hit the like goal, I'll put a present in the pin comment and in the description below. So, let me start off by showing you guys the first method where you don't need to be filming yourself. You're just going to simply be using full AI to do the whole process for you. So, guys, the first thing that I want to do is show you the product that I'm going to be using as the example with this new AI model method, which is going to be the Rose Teddy Bear. Now, this product I've chosen because it's one of the most recognizable products in the industry. And number two, it's almost Valentine's Day, so I thought it matches quite nicely and the colors pink in the background. So, I thought it all goes together very nicely. Now, the other reason why I chose this product is because this rose teddy bear has a lot of unique details that the AI will struggle to recreate. So, the more complex your product is, the harder it is for AI to recreate. But the reason why I chose this is to show you with this new AI model method, it can simply recreate these products without any problems and keep product consistency, which we all know that the three major issues is product consistency, character consistency, and the real skin tones with AI video ads. So, at this point of the video, guys, it would be helpful if you have your product ready in mind, and you take a screenshot of the product. So what I've done guys is I've simply took a print screen of my product like this so that I can give it to the AI to recreate. So you just need a simple image of the product on a white background like this. If you can also take another print screen of the product in a different angle. The more images and angles we have of the product on a white background, the better the results are going to be. So now I've took a print screen of the product on a white background. I can now move on. So guys, we now need to use the one tool that's going to
