VO3.1 Nano Banana Sora 2. There are all of these amazing models dropping. So, I figured why not just build a system where we can use all of them. So, what we're going to be looking at today is the ultimate UGC ads system where all you have to do is fill in some raw information on a Google sheet like a product photo, the ICP, the features of that product, and a setting of the video. And then all you have to do is come in here and choose your model. Whether that is V3.1, a combination of Nano Banana and V3.1, which is super cool. I'll show you guys exactly how we do that in a sec here, or using Sora 2. This lets you seamlessly test a bunch of different creatives and product features and settings across a ton of these different AI video generation models. So, the question that we're going to be trying to answer today is which one is best for UGC ads. So, taking a look at this workflow, you can see that there's basically three paths. There's the VO3.1 path, the Nano Banana Plus V3.1 path, and then the Sora 2 path. So, we're going to jump into a live demo. We're going to run all three of these paths, and I'm going to explain what every single node is doing so that you guys can set this up for yourself. And as always, I'm giving away the entire system for free. All you have to do is join my free school community. The link for that is down in the description. So, before we go ahead and run the live example, let's look at a few of our outputs that we've already gotten with this exact system. So, the first product we tried was creatine gummies. Here is what the actual product photo looks like. So, you can see it's a creatine gummy jar. We then have the ICP, which is young adults wanting to stay fit. The product features for this are delicious gummies, easy to remember to take daily, makes workouts better, more energetic, stuff like that. In the video setting, we have a young man who is parked in his car about to go into the gym holding the gummies. So, the first one we'll look at is Nano Banana Plus Google V3.1. >> I love that these creatine gummies actually give me more energy for my sets and they're tasty, so I actually remember to take them every day. >> All right, here's the same one with Sora 2. >> I love these creatine gummies. They actually taste amazing and I never forget to take them. They make my workout stronger and I feel more energized. >> And then here's V3.1. These taste amazing and I actually remember them every day for a my workouts feel stronger and I've got more energy. >> You may have noticed a few things with the reference image and the way they were speaking, but let's continue on to the second example which was hair shine spray. So, I'm going to go in the same order. Nano Banana Plus VO3.1 Sor 2 and then V3.1. >> I love how this gives my hair that glossy finish without any greasiness. It dries instantly and feels weightless. I love how this gives instant glossy shine without any greasiness. It dries fast and feels weightless. I love
