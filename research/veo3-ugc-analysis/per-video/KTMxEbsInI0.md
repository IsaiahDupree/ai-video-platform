Hello and welcome. In this video, I'll show you exactly how you can take any product and turn it into viral UGC ads using V3 and Google's brand new model, Nano Banana. The process is simple, fast, and repeatable. So, you can test, iterate, and actually start to create ads that convert. So, if you're ready to go, let's get started. Now, to create our UGC ads, I've broken the process down to three simple steps. First, we'll start by picking the product. This could be something that you already are selling or just some random product if you want to practice. I'll show you how to break that product down into scripts and angles that actually make sense for marketing. Next, we'll create the scenes. So, we will generate images for our ads. These aren't just random pictures. We're going to design proper ad scenes using Nano Banana, which can create avatars holding products and looking super realistic. And then finally, we'll take those images to generate our videos. Then we'll stitch them together into complete ads. By the end, you'll know exactly how to go from nothing to a finished ad. All created using Google's V3 and Nano Banana. And the best part, once you learn this process, you can repeat it with any product and scale it up as much as you want. So, let's get going and start finding our first product. I just went to Perplexity and searched what's the most trending products this month. It gave me a list and I picked the one that stood out. So, I went ahead with the smart water bottles and found a brand that could potentially be a good fit for what we're trying to do. So, I did some research and I found this brand. It's called Hydrate Spark and it could be very trendable because they have this LED light on the bottom and it seems like a quality product. It's also very simple to show in someone's hand and it works well in all settings. That means we can test a lot of ad angles and try multiple avatars, which makes this product a perfect demo. Once we're on the website, we need to find the actual product that we want. So, I'll go to Smart Drinkware and let's try this one. Once we're happy with the product and all of the images looks good, we'll take one or two of the images and just save them to our bank. So, I'll save this. And we'll also just get the product information so we can mark everything on this side, these drop-own menus to get as much information as possible about this product. Now that we have saved the images and copied the product information, we're going to paste all of that information into chat GBT. I also prepared a special prompt that acts like an expert product analyzer. So I'll leave a link for this prompt in the description. You can just copy this one and paste that into chat JBT. Just go to the top and paste that in. And I'll say here is our product info. Now chat GBT will break that down into key features, benefits, pain points, unique selling points, ideal customer profile, emotional hooks, and call to actions ideas. So this w
